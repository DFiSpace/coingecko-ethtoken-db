  The MXC vision is to introduce a systematic process to both simplify and increase IoT data transactions


  The decentralized infrastructure upon which MXC’s system is based is the future of Low Power Wide Access
  Network (LPWAN) and the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol). Utilizing this solid device network
  foundation, MXC is introducing an extraordinarily unique coin offering, Machine eXchange Coin (MXC),
  which allows for increased data transactions and an idiosyncratic data flow monetization within the
  mammoth data market.


  MXProtocol places a keen focus on reducing collision between networks, constructing an inter-chain data
  market, developing a market for network coverage and introducing an independent Quality of Services
  (QoS) framework for both data providers and receivers. For the first time ever, individual network users,
  corporations and enterprises can all participate in the construction of decentralized, ubiquitous and
  secure LPWAN. Simply by connecting “anything” to the network, adopters will be able to profit and trade
  MXC.


  The trading network is built on the premise of the “sharing economy.” Therefore, it is uniquely and
  exclusively owned by users — both individuals and enterprises — who take advantage of the monetization
  of the network in two ways: 1. By increasing uplink and downlink coverage via a Gateway, e.g. a MatchBox
  LPWAN Gateway, Cisco LPWAN Gateway 2. By unleashing access to a massive network of published and traded
  data to the marketplace which is securely traded using blockchain technology
