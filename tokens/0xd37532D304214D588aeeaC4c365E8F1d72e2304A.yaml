  FT is the proof of rights of the FCoin trading platform itself, and it has an innovative "trading or
  mining" mechanism. The total amount of FT issuance is constant at 10 billion yuan and will never be
  issued. FCoin will allocate most of its revenue to FT's holders in a timely manner. At the same time,
  FT holders share the rights of the community in governance.


  FT is the token issued by FCoin. The entire issued FT base equates to the overall ownership of FCoin
  trading platform which adopts an innovative “Trans-Fee Mining” model. The total number of issued FTs
  is set at 10 billion and will never increase. FCoin, the platform, will instantaneously distribute the
  bulk of its revenue to FT holders. At the same time, FT holders have certain rights in governing the
  FCoin community.


  The F Token (FT) as a circulated-encrypted certificate to various digitized rights, will become the
  basis of the platform’s future digital economy. The FT represents a stake in the FCoin community, it
  is the cornerstone of FCoin’s community governance.

  FCoin’s Community Reward Mechanism: “Trans-Fee Mining”


  This community reward mechanism  utilizes FCoin’s innovative and proprietary“Trans-Fee Mining” model,
  in which we will regularly reward community members in the form of FTs as a way of giving back to the
  members/users over time. We will reimburse all members/users’ transaction fees spent on the platform
  in the form of FTs by using up to 51% of the platform’s total FTs (10 billion) to do so.


  Every reward “cycle” is 1 calendar day. We will calculate the number of FTs to be given back or rewarded
  based on the average FT price of the previous cycle.
