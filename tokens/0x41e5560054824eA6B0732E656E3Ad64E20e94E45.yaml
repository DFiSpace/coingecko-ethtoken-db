  Using blockchain technology in an unprecedented way, Civic is more than just a coin or a cryptocurrency
  to trade. It’s an identity verification platform which is meant to make life easier, not only for the
  user but also for the entity who wishes to verify the identity. Rather than going through a long-winded
  document verification process, the Civic token enables the verification of identity directly in places
  where it is accepted. The Civic coin or Civic token (CVC) is the currency associated with Civic, which
  thrives on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> blockchain, primarily
  exchanged during the identity verification process.


  As a platform, the Civic cryptocurrency shows a lot of promise. While it is only available in the US
  presently (which may be disappointing news about its current potential), it’ll soon expand and come
  over to other countries - which should give it a nice bump in value. The blockchain is where the future
  lies, and the Civic coin uses it in a unique way to make life easier and our identity more secure.
