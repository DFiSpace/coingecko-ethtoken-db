{"address":"0x9992eC3cF6A55b00978cdDF2b27BC6882d88D1eC","description":"Polymath simplifies the legal process of creating and selling security tokens. It makes a new token standard, the ST20, and enforces government compliance. Only a \u201clist of authorized investors and their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> wallet addresses\u201d can hold ST20 tokens. Therefore, token issuers don\u2019t need to worry about the legal implications of your security falling into the wrong hands. In order to launch a legally compliant token, the Polymath platform brings together issuers, legal delegates, smart contract developers, KYC verification, and a decentralized exchange. All transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token.\n\nPolymath has programmable equity. Polymath enables companies to take control of their equity issuance through programmable code. It is raising in cryptocurrency opens up an entire wealth of new investors. Polymath eliminates the middleman and financial structures that hinder the deployment of equity. There is a trove of wealth that is untouched by Wall Street that can now be accessed through Polymath.\n\nIn 2017, Polymath raised over $1.2 billion in funding by selling utility tokens and security tokens. Utility tokens, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waltonchain\">Waltonchain</a>, give you access to a token\u2019s network and are far more common than security tokens. Security tokens, however, provide equity or a claim to dividends from a company. As a result, security tokens, like any securities, are subject to government regulation. Polymath\u2019s new standard for blockchain security tokens aims to embed the necessary regulatory requirements into smart contracts and comply entirely with government security regulations.\n\nA wide array of security tokens that will be listed on Polymath at some point will require investors to be accredited, or to be from specific countries.","id":"polymath-network","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2645420,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x9992ec3cf6a55b00978cddf2b27bc6882d88d1ec","https://etherscan.io/token/0x9992ec3cf6a55b00978cddf2b27bc6882d88d1ec","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9992ec3cf6a55b00978cddf2b27bc6882d88d1ec"],"facebook_username":"polymathnetwork","homepage":["https://www.polymath.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-apps","https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core","https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-issuer","https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-offchain","https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-ui"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PolymathNetwork/","telegram_channel_identifier":"PolymathNetwork","twitter_screen_name":"PolymathNetwork"},"name":"Polymath Network","symbol":"poly","tickers":[{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"AXN"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"bkex","name":"Bkex"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"daybit","name":"Daybit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"daybit","name":"Daybit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POY","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POY","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"XRP"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"POLY","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"USDT"}]}
