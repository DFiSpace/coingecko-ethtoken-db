  XLC is a token that is made as an exchange currency like a common currency. However, XLC is used to
  payment tokens, such as payment of online goods or other words, XLC will later be used as mature money
  to buy goods, By looking at the development of cryptocurrency at this time.


  How it's work?


  XLC will also take on the role of mature exchange money in the present. XLC will be used to marketplace
  and used to shop goods digitally.


  The XLC function includes


  * Crypto digital currency


  * Exchange tools in the Marketplace ( Online Shop )


  We also target that XLC will later be used as a real exchange tool, that is by using an exchange through
  QR codes.
