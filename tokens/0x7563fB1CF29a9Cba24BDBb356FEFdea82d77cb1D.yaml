  Reports shows, Crypto miners are using more electricity than Serbia, Eric Holthaus calculated that by
  July 2019 Bitcoin would require more electricity than all of the United States and that by November
  of 2020, we’d use more electricity mining than the entire world. This sort of precipitous rise is stunning
  and poses great danger towards our climate in which it’s effects are already evident. Cryptocurrencies
  are here to stay but it’s environmental effects needs to be addressed early on. HashByte ensues to foster
  the current cryptocurrency mining landscape towards a green / renewable model, annihilating the need
  for fossil fuel powered electricity.
