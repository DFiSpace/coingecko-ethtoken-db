It is first in the market to be backed by Ethereum. As a result, it will serve as the first \u2018Casper\u2019 mining/staking pool to the digital token Market. \u2018Casper\u2019 is known as the \u2018Proof of Stake\u2019 or POS upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain. This particular upgrade goes green regarding energy usage, in which the Ethereum blockchain no longer uses energy-wasting \u2018Proof of Work\u2019 mining, but rather, more secure, energy saving POS. In order for POS to be profitable for those with limited Ether, they will need to pool Ether with others. Mithril Ore is the first advanced staking pool to the market, providing access to POS mining, and will utilize this service in a crowd-friendly way.\n\nOne hundred percent of the Ethereum raised in the Mithril Ore token crowdsale will be placed into the Ether Mining/Staking Pool \u2013 with none taken as profits. As an additional feature of the Mithril Ore token, all Ethereum created as a result of advanced staking from \u2018Casper\u2019 will be returned to the Mithril Ore Ether Pool; thereby, adding more Ethereum to the Mithril Ore Mining/Staking Pool.\n\nMithril Ore tokens are limited in number and therefore scarce. In future years, token holders may elect to offer and consolidate tokens with the \u201cblacksmith option.\u201d With consolidation, \u2018blacksmith minted\u2019 item tokens offer annual, limited time, limited edition tokens that connote concentrated values and voting privileges at the option of current token holders.","developer_score":12.0,"id":"mithril-ore","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5783/large/Logo-Dark-Icon.png?1547041653","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5783/small/Logo-Dark-Icon.png?1547041653","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5783/thumb/Logo-Dark-Icon.png?1547041653"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x501262281b2ba043e2fbf14904980689cddb0c78","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x501262281b2ba043e2fbf14904980689cddb0c78"],"facebook_username":"mithrilore","homepage":["http://www.mithrilore.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/mithrilore/browser-solidity"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MithrilOre/","twitter_screen_name":"mithrilore"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":5847,"name":"Mithril Ore","public_interest_score":26.881,"symbol":"more","tickers":[]}
