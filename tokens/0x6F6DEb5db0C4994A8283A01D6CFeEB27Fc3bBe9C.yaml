  SmartBillions is not a company. It's a smart contract that conducts a decentralized lottery with a theoretically
  unlimited Jackpot potential. We believe the quality and value of SmartBillions contract technology will
  validate its superiority above all existing lottery services. To verify the security of the SmartBillions
  contract, the SmartBillions Team will host a hackathon 7 days prior to the start of the limited crowdfunding
  Token (PLAY) sales. The SmartBillions development team will place 1500 ETH in the contract Jackpot and
  offer an open invitation for anyone to try and hack the contract and withdraw the funds. The hackathon
  will prove the security of the contract and certify that Token holdersâ€™ investments are fully protected.
