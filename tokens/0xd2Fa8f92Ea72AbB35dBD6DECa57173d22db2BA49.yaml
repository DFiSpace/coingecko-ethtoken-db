  The Origami Network has created a blockchain-enabled, decentralized marketplace platform to address
  various problems related to online business platforms such as efficient development, maintenance, payments
  on escrow, and the management of reviews.


  This is a well-planned, high-tech platform, with many advanced and functional virtual products. With
  quite a substantial number of members (to support the project) already on board, this project is fully
  operational.


  There are three full-scale platforms based on this parent project:


  Origami Marketplace.

  Origami Payment.

  Origami Review.
