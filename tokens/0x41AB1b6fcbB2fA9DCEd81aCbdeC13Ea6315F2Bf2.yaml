  XinFin (www.XinFin.org) is a Hybrid Blockchain technology company focused on international trade and
  finance. We have developed a highly scalable, secure, permissioned and commercial grade Blockchain architecture.
  XinFin Blockchain is powered by XDC01 protocol, which is built over the first of its kind Hybrid Blockchain
  architecture to eliminate the inefficiencies in global trade and financing and to enable institutions
  provide real time settlement as well as enabling cross border smart contracts.


  XDC protocol is architected to support smart contracts layer, KYC/AML layer and price stability using
  it's hedge pool for existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoincash BCH, Litecoin LTC and Ripple
  XRP on it's tradefinex.org platform. The XDC protocol also supports FIAT payment methods and will support
  upcoming nationally issued cryptocurrencies.


  XinFin has released a swappable token under the ticker, XDCE. Releasing an ERC20 token has a wide array
  of benefits for traders, private investors and institutional level partners. The XDCE token will largely
  be for traders to compete against other ERC20 tokens across exchange boards making XinFin's reach more
  versatile in the open Crypto Market and can be swapped with the standard XDC token. The XDCE token will
  be available and will be tradeable on most exchanges. This means traders will reap the benefit of high
  volume and quick trades through multiple exchanges. Traders, by using the XDCE token, will allow for
  the XDC01 (XDC) token to be used primarily for institutional level partners. Most importantly, this
  will also allow the XDC01 to grow strictly from use cases, all the while keeping traders, using XDCE,
  connected and benefiting from the growth of the XDC01.
