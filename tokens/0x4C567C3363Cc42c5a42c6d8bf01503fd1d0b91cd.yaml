  Elementh has absorbed the best achievements of recent years in the field of blockchain, aiming at solving
  the problems of the modern world of e-commerce. Elementh is a blockchain for e-commerce, which is a
  register of ownership of goods with the ability to write specialized smart contracts and use of the
  nomenclature standard to quickly create various decentralized and centralized applications for e-commerce.

  Elementh's goal is to create an alternative protocol for the development of decentralized applications
  used by e-commerce, providing a standard quality nomenclature, guaranteeing ownership of a particular
  product and the ability to create specialized smart contracts for e-commerce. Elementh will achieve
  this by creating a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing everyone
  to write smart contracts and decentralized applications, enabling the use of unified product cards,
  e-commerce transactions and the transfer of ownership.
