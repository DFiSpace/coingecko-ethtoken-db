  Aventus is a fair, secure, and transparent blockchain-based event ticketing solution that practically
  eliminates fraud and unregulated touting. Organisers can create, manage and promote their events and
  tickets with dramatically reduced platform costs, and can set price controls and receive commissions
  on secondary market sales.


  The Aventus Protocol:  Blockchain for Ticketing

  An open-source protocol that delivers the global standard for ticketing. The protocol permits rights
  holders to define rules across the ticketing supply-chain - including promoters, venues primary / secondary
  agents - to which everyone must adhere.


  THE AVENTUS TOKEN (AVT)

  It is essential for aligning the economic incentives in the secure and transparent network to ensure
  fraudulent behaviour is identified and eliminated.


  AVT is used by the network in 3 key ways:

  1. Voting on the legitimacy of events in the protocol

  A means to prevent spamming in the network, and to ensure that all entities across the ticket supply
  chain, who will be interacting with the inventory, can contribute to the due diligence process, which
  is currently undertaken by a single entity.


  2. Creating a token-curated registry of legitimate applications

  Using the protocol in order that ticketing rights holders and consumers have a single source of truth
  for verifying that the ticketing application in question is using the protocol legitimately and not
  circumventing rules via off-chain fees and terms and conditions.


  3. Facilitating the non-deterministic matching of buyers and sellers of tickets in the secondary market

  By using proof of stake-like mechanisms. This is essential for preventing secondary market participants
  from circumventing the rules imposed by the rights holder, leading to unregulated resale.
