  Inverse XTZ by Synthetix


  Inversely tracks the price of Tezos through price feeds supplied by an oracle. Its value freezes when
  it reaches its upper limit of $1.47 (i.e. when Tezos’s value reaches $0.49) or its lower limit of $0.49
  (i.e. when Tezos’s value reaches $1.47). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will
  no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at
  its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted for
  another iXTZ with different limits.
