  Crowd Machine is creating the Crowd Computer, a decentralized app execution engine that is powered by
  a peer-to-peer network of Crowd Virtual Machines ("CVM") that run on peer devices by device owners who
  are paid for their excess capacity.  The Crowd Virtual Machine is blockchain-agnostic and can be used
  to develop and execute smart contracts and decentralized apps on any blockchain.
