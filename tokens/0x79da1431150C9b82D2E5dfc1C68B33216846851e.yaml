description: >-
  Inversely tracks the price of Litecoin (LTC) through price feeds supplied by an oracle. The entry point
  is $58.73 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when it reaches its
  upper limit of $88.095 (i.e. when Litecoin's value reaches $29.365) or its lower limit of $29.365 (i.e.
  when Litecoinâ€™s value reaches $88.095). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will
  no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at
  its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted for
  another iLTC with different limits.
