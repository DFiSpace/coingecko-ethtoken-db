  Kin is a decentralized cryptocurrency token issued on Ethereum, an open-source public blockchain. It
  was created by Kik Interactive in September 2017 in a token distribution event, raising over $98 million
  from 10,000 participants. The purpose of the token is to facilitate value transfers in digital services
  such as gaming applications and social media, and will initially be launched on the Kik messenger to
  leverage the application's 15 million monthly active users. Use of Kin over other tokens is incentivised
  by providing a daily reward to developers of these digital services based on their usage.


  Kik’s latest effort has been allowing users to reward creators directly. Today’s digital content and
  social media companies monetize their websites using advertising. This model requires that these companies
  go after economies of scale, adding new users quickly. They also want new users to spend as much time
  as possible on their platform so they can maximize ad views and therefore revenue. The leadership at
  Kik believes this trend toward the attention economy is a mistake. Their philosophical argument for
  creating a cryptocurrency is that advertising and attention seeking is cheapening the content ecosystem
  and our relationships. Using Kin Coin, they hope to enable consumers to pay creators and developers
  directly. This crowdsourced patronage is an important trend in social media. We’re seeing similar projects
  that have gained traction with the likes of Kickstarter or Patreon. These services allow people to pay
  creators directly, without the need for advertisers.


  Kik needed further funding in 2017. Instead of raising money from venture capitalists, they decided
  to launch an ICO to create the token behind their new rewards points system. The token sale for Kin
  Coin was a success, raising $98 million in September 2017. The sale included over 10,000 people from
  117 countries. Unfortunately, Canadian citizens were not allowed to participate, and Kik is a Canadian
  company. Some argue this dampened demand and contributed to the ICO not reaching its hard cap of $110
  million. A total of 10 trillion KIN will exist, of which 750 billion are currently in circulation. The
  token launched on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>.


  Kin Coin will launch on Kik later this year. The idea is for monetization to integrate seamlessly into
  the app. Users should be able to reward creators simply from their wallets with a few taps. Kin Coin
  is designed to be mobile-first, and a wallet app will arrive in the coming months as well. A few test
  users can use Kin Coin right now on Kik. The only thing you can do so far is buy some custom digital
  stickers for use in chats. Expect more features upon launch later this year. Over time, the idea is
  to allow other digital services and media applications to also integrate KIN. It won’t be exclusive
  to Kik. However, Kik will be the first company to launch Kin Coin integration.


  KIN’s value decreased following the ICO as hype died down. In January, KIN rode the wave along with
  much of the cryptocurrency market to an all-time high. Since January, the price has fallen, but never
  to pre-January levels. KIN is an ERC-20 token, so you can store it anywhere that accepts Ethereum. <a

  is a good option for paper storage. Of course, a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet is the gold standard
  for security. Kin has the backing of a major startup with a large active user base. This is an interesting
  opportunity to see how well crypto integrates with an existing community, especially a younger community
  who might not care about crypto. They just want things to work well. Solving the problem of giving crypto
  a great user experience is an important step to making crypto useful. If Kik can figure that out with
  the Kin Coin then this will be an interesting project to follow.
