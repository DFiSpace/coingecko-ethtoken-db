  ESPORTS CHAIN

  The trust foundation of Esports ecosystem in digital era. This project aims at applying blockchain technology
  to establishing the value network.


  EST Token

  Based on the features of game and Esports ecosystem, we will establish POC (Proof of Contribution)-based
  consensus mechanism. We will launch EST Token by rewarding players and users in game and Esports area
  to do the early EST Token promotion.


  Game Virtual Asset Trading Platform

  Based on the decentralization feature of blockchain, we offer a new product solution to meet the transaction
  demands of game and Esports players. Our goal is to solve the problems existing in the the traditional
  centralized trading platforms such as the low efficiency and low controllability of trading risks.


  New Esports Game Prediction Platform

  Based on the credit guarantee mechanism of peer-to-peer transaction enabled by blockchain, we are able
  to eliminate participators’ risks caused by unreliable traditional centralized platform. We also decrease
  the difficulity of launching game prediction and meet users’ individualized prediction needs.


  Smart Game and Esports Events System

  Based on the autonomous feature and smart contracts of blockchain, we make the launching and management
  of Esports games easier, and give reasonable interest distribution and rewards to the mass Esports games
  for their contribution to the Esports ecosystem.


  The producing and trading of Esports IP derived products

  Based on the tamper-resistance feature of blockchain, we produce and enable the trading of Esports players’
  IP derived products (digital limited edition ). We remove all the third party’s involvement and allow
  the direct and straight value passing from Esports players to their fans and the “fan economy”’s direct
  value return to players themselves.
