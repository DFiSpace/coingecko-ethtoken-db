  The Digital Asset Exchange Token (symbol: DAXT) is BlockEx’s ICO. It is a utility token in which allows
  holders access to buy ICO tokens on BlockEx Markets ICO Market on a pre-sale basis before the public
  at large. This will be used to unlock the Pot Allocation System during the pre-sale of ICOs on the BlockEx
  ICO Market, guaranteeing an allocation of tokens. It will be ERC223 compliant, so can be sold on the
  secondary market, both on our DAxP, and eventually on other platforms supporting tokens following the
  ERC20 standard.


  In order for you to buy ICOs on a pre-sale basis, you must pay 2.5 percent of the notional purchase
  amount in terms of DAXTs. For example, if you wanted to buy €100 worth of ABC tokens you must pay 2.5
  DAXTs in conjunction with the funds. The Pot Allocation System automatically calculates and adjusts
  each individual’s token allocation proportionate to the total funds received relative to the token supply
  available. Therefore, the DAXT guarantees token allocation tokens listed on the ICO Market.
