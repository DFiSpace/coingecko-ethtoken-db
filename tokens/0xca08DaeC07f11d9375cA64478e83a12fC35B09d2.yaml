  XMRT Monero Token is a fan-based token on the Ethereum Classic Blockchain. ItÂ´s a means of payment and
  can be used for any purpose. It has nothing to do with the original MoneroXMR and is a completely separate
  cryptocurrency. Pointing to transparency which is needed for companies. But we still believe in full
  privacy for non-commercial users.
