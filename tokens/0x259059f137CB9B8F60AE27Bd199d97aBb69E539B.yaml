description: >-
  SpectrumNetwork is a GIS based hybrid blockchain system leveraging on Blockchain technology to decentralize
  geospatial data visualization. SpectrumNetwork designed SPEC utility tokens consisting of spatial signatures
  and a proof-of-location algorithm, to bridge a recurring gap between geospatial data management, distribution
  and cost reduction. In casual contexts, geo-refrenced vector quantities of the earth are now more to
  say, a cryptographic token.
