  GNAIT Smart Tokens can be used for the consumption and circulation of a wide range of modern artificial
  intelligence services. GNAI uses the decentralization of blockchain to establish AI services on the
  blockchain so that the model can be publicly evaluated and tested. At the same time, GNAI will provide
  protocols such as chain proxy and cross-chain communication, making each user access effective and secure.
  GNAIT obtains tokens through data sharing, and the computing power uses the method of consuming tokens
  to motivate communities to create data and share computing power.
