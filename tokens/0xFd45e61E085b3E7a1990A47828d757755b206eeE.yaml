  Trading on CoinPark is considered as mining and the user is considered as a “miner”. The mining output
  is CP. You only need to trade on CoinPark, and the resulting transaction fees will be automatically
  converted to CP, and pay dividends to the CP holder\'s account one hour a time from 0:00 am (Singapore
  time) on the following day, the dividends for each hour calculated from the same hour period of previous
  day.


  * CP is an abbreviation for CoinParkToken, which is an Ethereum ERC20 standard token. CP was generated
  through the "transaction is mining" method, with a total of 10 billion, of which 60% was excavated by
  miners, and the remaining 40% was pre-issued and frozen. The frozen portion was also thawed daily as
  miners began digging.
