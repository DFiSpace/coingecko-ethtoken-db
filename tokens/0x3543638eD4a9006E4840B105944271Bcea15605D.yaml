  U Network is a revolutionary protocol for publishing and valuing online content that helps online content
  platforms better align with the interests of their users. It does this by rewarding content creators
  more for their work, by letting users earn money for predicting popular content, by making it easier
  to discover high-quality content, and by allowing all users to be part of content moderation and governance
  decisions. The first online content community powered by U Network will be U Community, a digital asset
  information community.


  In 2015, U Network team launches SV Insight, a Silicon Valley tech media company with over 4 million
  subscribers. In the year 2017, U Network team develops blockchain educational content together with
  Huobi, attracting over 30,000 paying users. Besides, U Network team launches a smart contract developers
  boot camp, training over 300 blockchain developers.
