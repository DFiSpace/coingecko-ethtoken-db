description: >-
  Rocket Pool is a next generation pool designed to work with Casper, the new consensus protocol that
  Ethereum will transition to in 2018. It was the first working implementation of a Proof of Stake pool
  and features several first to market features; such as load balancing across multiple cloud hosting
  providers using smart contracts, minipools, widow addresses and deposit tokens. Rocket Pool isn’t just
  a whitepaper, it’s actual code.


  Rocket Pool is a decentralised Ethereum Proof of Stake pool.

  We allow individuals and businesses the ability to earn interest on their ether and offer a full 3rd
  Party API for current businesses that wish to provide their users with Proof of Stake services.
