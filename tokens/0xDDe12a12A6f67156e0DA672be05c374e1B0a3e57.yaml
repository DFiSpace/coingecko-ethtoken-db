  JOYSO, the Ethereum based exchange, offers the speed of a centralised platform while providing the security
  and privacy of a decentralized exchange.


  This hybrid exchange  (HEX), able to handle all ERC20-compatible tokens, eliminates the need to trust
  a central exchange with your private key or personal information, reducing to a historical minimum any
  opportunities for hacking. It takes order placement and order matching off-chain, substantially improving
  the user experience compared to decentralized exchanges.
