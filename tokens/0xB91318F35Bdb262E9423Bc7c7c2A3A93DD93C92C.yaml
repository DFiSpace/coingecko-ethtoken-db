  Nuls (NULS) is a Singaporean based project is trying to develop a highly adaptable blockchain that can
  be used for enterprise solutions. They have regularly used the phrase “Nuls is nothing, Nuls is everything”.
  In other words, Nuls is not traditionally defined and can be melded into anything that the community
  sees fit.


  Nuls is looking to solve the problems faced by blockchains by creating one that features modularity
  and sub-chain operability. The two part design of functional modules and microkernels will provide both
  an underlying network mechanism and compartmentalized features for the blockchain.Essentially this should
  provide scalability and security to the blockchain, while adhering to the programming practices of low
  coupling and high cohesion. And because the blockchain is designed to be modular, it becomes hot pluggable,
  allowing for the addition or removal of modules at any time.


  There are several blockchain problems inhibiting growth and development of the industry that have been
  identified by the Nuls team. One such issue is the cost of development. Because there is a shortage
  of blockchain proficient developers, those with skills can command higher salaries.This is simply demand
  exceeding supply and will eventually level out as more IT professionals learn blockchain skills. That’s
  when businesses will see greater adoption of the technology, and only the most trustworthy blockchains
  will be of interest. Nuls is working to make trustworthy solutions to business problems.


  Nuls is primarily focused on making blockchain more accessible for developers and businesses. It seeks
  to do this through its modularity and the use of sub-chains, and hopes to break the complexity associated
  with blockchain projects, while also solving the scalability issue that is hindering the growth of the
  industry. Nuls will make trust simpler, increasing the adoption rate of blockchain technology by businesses.
  They will also lower the cost of entry by removing complexity and increasing the supply of developers
  capable of programming blockchain applications. Taken all together, the Nuls ecosystem will benefit
  developers, businesses, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts by providing needed solutions and increasing
  usage and adoption of blockchain technology.
