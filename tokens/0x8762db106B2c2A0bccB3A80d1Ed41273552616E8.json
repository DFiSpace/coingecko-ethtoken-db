Ultimately, Reserve\u2019s goal is to create a universal store of value \u2013 particularly in regions with unreliable banking infrastructure and regions where hyperinflation is an issue. The Reserve system will interact with three kinds of tokens:\n\n(1) The Reserve token (RSV), which is a stable cryptocurrency that can be held and spent the way we use normal fiat money;\n\n(2) The Reserve Rights token (RSR), a protocol token used to facilitate the stability of RSV.\n\n(3) A growing variety of tokenized real-world assets (such as other stablecoins) that are held by the Reserve smart contract to back RSV.","developer_score":28.904,"id":"reserve-rights-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/large/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/small/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/thumb/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8"],"homepage":["https://reserve.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"reservecurrency","twitter_screen_name":"reserveprotocol"},"liquidity_score":46.752,"market_cap_rank":120,"name":"Reserve Rights Token","public_interest_score":3.82,"symbol":"rsr","tickers":[{"base":"0X8762DB106B2C2A0BCCB3A80D1ED41273552616E8","market":{"identifier":"balancer","name":"Balancer"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"0X8762DB106B2C2A0BCCB3A80D1ED41273552616E8","market":{"identifier":"balancer","name":"Balancer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"0X8762DB106B2C2A0BCCB3A80D1ED41273552616E8","market":{"identifier":"balancer","name":"Balancer"},"target":"USDC"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"bitcoin_com","name":"Bitcoin.com"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"bitcratic","name":"Bitcratic"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"eterbase","name":"Eterbase"},"target":"EBASE"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"}]}
