Ultimately, Reserve\u2019s goal is to create a universal store of value \u2013 particularly in regions with unreliable banking infrastructure and regions where hyperinflation is an issue. The Reserve system will interact with three kinds of tokens:\n\n(1) The Reserve token (RSV), which is a stable cryptocurrency that can be held and spent the way we use normal fiat money;\n\n(2) The Reserve Rights token (RSR), a protocol token used to facilitate the stability of RSV.\n\n(3) A growing variety of tokenized real-world assets (such as other stablecoins) that are held by the Reserve smart contract to back RSV. The Reserve project is backed by people like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, YCombinator Chairman Sam Altman, and other influential Silicon Valley and crypto investors.","developer_score":27.476,"id":"reserve-rights-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/large/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/small/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8365/thumb/Reserve_Rights.png?1557737411"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8762db106b2c2a0bccb3a80d1ed41273552616e8"],"homepage":["https://reserve.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/reserve-protocol/rsr"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"reservecurrency","twitter_screen_name":"reserveprotocol"},"liquidity_score":39.967,"market_cap_rank":173,"name":"Reserve Rights Token","public_interest_score":44.392,"symbol":"rsr","tickers":[{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"bilaxy","name":"Bilaxy"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"CoinExchange.io"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"CoinExchange.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RSR","market":{"identifier":"eterbase","name":"Eterbase"},"target":"ETH"}]}
