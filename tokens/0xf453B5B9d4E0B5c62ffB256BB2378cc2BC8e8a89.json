The platform supports a crypto economy and is powered by Blockchain. MARK.SPACE supports all Internet browsers (preferably Chrome) and, at the same time, is compatible with CardBoard, Oculus and HTC Vive. A desktop PC or tablet is all that is needed to create a state-of-the-art VR store, office, community or other space for business or entertainment. The MARK.SPACE universe consists of multiple VR spaces (units), in which each unit can be linked directly to its own top-level domain. The property right to the units is guaranteed by recording all transactions involving units (creation, sale, purchase or rental) on the Blockchain. All unit owners may buy, sell or rent their units to others using smart contracts. MARK.SPACE has an internal currency - the MARK token (MRK), which is a utility token (not a paper bond), allowing all users to sell and buy VR spaces and objects, consume various goods and use services, pay salaries to their employees and to buy ads to promote their businesses through the MARK.SPACE platform. GPU-miners who will be rendering VR spaces and objects for the platform\u2019s users will also receive rewards in MRK tokens (Proof of Work (PoW) Concept).","id":"mark-space","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2294605,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xf453b5b9d4e0b5c62ffb256bb2378cc2bc8e8a89","https://etherscan.io/token/0xf453b5b9d4e0b5c62ffb256bb2378cc2bc8e8a89","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf453b5b9d4e0b5c62ffb256bb2378cc2bc8e8a89"],"facebook_username":"markspace.io","homepage":["http://markspace.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/markspace","telegram_channel_identifier":"markspaceio","twitter_screen_name":"markspaceio"},"name":"MARK.SPACE","symbol":"mrk","tickers":[{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"btc_alpha","name":"BTC-Alpha"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"orderbook","name":"Orderbook.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"MRK","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]}
