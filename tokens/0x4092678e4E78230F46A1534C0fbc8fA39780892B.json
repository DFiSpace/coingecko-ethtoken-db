Odyssey dreams big - aiming to completely replace the concept of private ownership with an economy in which everything is shared and little is owned. It\u2019s a long way from its goals, of course, but making peer-to-peer sharing more efficient with smart contracts is certainly a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Odyssey website lists 9 advisors, with its primary two being Yi Shi, the CEO of Shanghai\u2019s Avazu Holding, a leading global advertising platform, and Justin Sun, the backbone of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">TRON</a> cryptocurrency. The advisory team also includes Goh Jian Kai, founder and CEO of Southeast Asia\u2019s cross-border payment solution system RateX.\n\nOdyssey has lofty goals, aiming to create a world where sharing is the norm and ownership or sharing monopoly doesn\u2019t come in the way of people\u2019s lives. A decentralized sharing platform where all service providers and customers are connected definitely sounds attractive. It\u2019s a new currency, so it needs development to reach its goals. Of course, the fact that buying a large number of OCN tokens will not put a major dent in your pocket is a definite point in its favour.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"odyssey","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2559/large/ocn.png?1547036683","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2559/small/ocn.png?1547036683","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2559/thumb/ocn.png?1547036683"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4092678e4e78230f46a1534c0fbc8fa39780892b","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4092678e4E78230F46A1534C0fbc8fA39780892B","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4092678e4e78230f46a1534c0fbc8fa39780892b"],"facebook_username":"ODYSSEYPROTOCOL","homepage":["http://www.ocnex.net/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"OdysseyOfficial","twitter_screen_name":"OdysseyOCN"},"liquidity_score":33.807,"market_cap_rank":195,"name":"Odyssey","public_interest_score":34.295,"symbol":"ocn","tickers":[{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"CoinExchange.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"OCN","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"USDT"}]}
