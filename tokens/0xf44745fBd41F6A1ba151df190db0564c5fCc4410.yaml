  COPYTRACK - Global Copyright Register. At the core of COPYTRACK is the creation of a global decentralized
  copyright register for digital content, which authenticates users and links digital intellectual property.
  This registry will generate a unique ecosystem for rights-holders, thereby providing new e-client marketplaces.
  With its cutting edge technology and processes, it is well-suited to globally address the key challenges
  in the industry and will be open to the public.


  COPYTRACK provides a tool to comfortably navigate this process without any risk or hassle to rights-holders.
  We offer our service free of charge, and even bear the risk of legal fees. COPYTRACK only takes a small
  success-related commission. The benefits for rights-holders are:


  - Free use of platform

  - Zero risk of legal enforcement

  - Focus: “post”-licensing

  - Fair approach for both parties
