  Starting with photos, Wemark is building a blockchain-based marketplace for digital content. The $4B
  stock photography market is currently controlled by Shutterstock and Getty Images which take up to 85%
  of what creators earn.


  With Wemark, creators license their content directly to customers over the blockchain, and by doing
  so, they keep much more of their revenue and rights to their content, while customers get access to
  better photos at better prices.
