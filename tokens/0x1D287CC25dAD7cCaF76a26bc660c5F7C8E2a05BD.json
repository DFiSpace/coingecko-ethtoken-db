Fetch.AI's digital world is exposed to agents via its Open Economic Framework (OEF) and is underpinned by unique smart ledger technology to deliver high performance, low cost transactions. The ledger delivers useful proof-of-work that builds market intelligence and trust over time \u2014 growing the value of the network as it is used. Fetch.AI can be neatly interfaced to existing systems with minimal effort, allowing it to take advantage of the old economy whilst building the new: plug existing data in to Fetch.AI and watch markets spontaneously form from the bottom up.","id":"fetch-ai","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/fetch-ai"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/address/0x1d287cc25dad7ccaf76a26bc660c5f7c8e2a05bd","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1d287cc25dad7ccaf76a26bc660c5f7c8e2a05bd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1d287cc25dad7ccaf76a26bc660c5f7c8e2a05bd"],"homepage":["https://fetch.ai/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/fetchai/ledger"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FetchAI_Community/","telegram_channel_identifier":"fetch_ai","twitter_screen_name":"fetch_ai"},"name":"Fetch AI","symbol":"fet","tickers":[{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"bitmax","name":"BitMax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"coinbit","name":"Coinbit"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"crypto_bridge","name":"CryptoBridge"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"crypto_bridge","name":"CryptoBridge"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FET","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"BTC"}]}
