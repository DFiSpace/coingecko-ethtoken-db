With this system, the meaning of each cryptographic waypoint is only accessible for interpretation by the parties involved in the shipment itself. This gives shippers more visibility across their supply chain, and allows carriers to communicate with ease.\n\nInformation about loads, geo waypoints, and other basic information is recorded and publicly validated within the sidechain. On the shipment's delivery and confirmation, the contract is completed and stored on the main blockchain.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"shipchain","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3997/large/shipchain.png?1548609236","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3997/small/shipchain.png?1548609236","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3997/thumb/shipchain.png?1548609236"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xe25b0bba01dc5630312b6a21927e578061a13f55","https://etherscan.io/token/0xe25b0bba01dc5630312b6a21927e578061a13f55","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe25b0bba01dc5630312b6a21927e578061a13f55"],"facebook_username":"shipchain","homepage":["https://www.shipchain.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"shipchain","twitter_screen_name":"shipchain"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":2045,"name":"ShipChain","public_interest_score":25.386,"symbol":"ship","tickers":[]}
