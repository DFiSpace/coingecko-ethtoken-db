  Inspired by emerging deflationary currency projects, we wondered what a regenerative currency could
  achieve. Could a regenerative currency also achieve deflation?


  For this, we created Palmes, the world's first regenerative currency. When it is transacted, a new fraction
  is generated.


  Specifically, for every 1 Palmes traded, 0.000001 plm arises. Every 1 million transactions, 1 Palmes
  is created. If there are no transactions, there will be no new tokens.
