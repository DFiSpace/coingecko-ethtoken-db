One of the important components of the project is a digital DNA storage or electronic Biobank.\n\nThe name of the CTAGtoken token is an abbreviation of 4 types of nitrogenous bases that form DNA chains (Cytosine, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine). S.Genomics created CTAGtoken as a unit of a calculation inside an ecosystem.\n\nYou can use CTAGtoken for purchase DNA tests and get your health passport; get a cell to store your genomic data in a Biobank; use to pay for the lease of the computing power of neural network for research purposes.","id":"ctagtoken","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xb0f14f66cae71164d89e8a0cf0875ef2c32fb660"],"homepage":["http://ctagtoken.com/"]},"name":"CTAGtoken","symbol":"ctag","tickers":[{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"USD"}]}
