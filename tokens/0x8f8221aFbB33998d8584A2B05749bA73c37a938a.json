The request can be detected and paid in a secure way, without the need to involve a third party. The request is saved on an immutable, authentic ledger, which acts as a unique source of truth for accounting and auditing processes. Request integrates a trade law system and works across every legislation. Request works with every global currency. Request is designed to be flexible, to last hundreds of years, and to work with IoT, whilst being compatible with any future systems.\n\nRequest donation modal went live today. Thought you might be interested to include it in your footer instead of just the addresses. As an FYI, it's fully decentralized and free to use -- we don't take any added fees (the only cost is the Ethereum gas). It can be integrated with a simple code snippet.\n\nAnyways, check it out if you have a chance -- here's a link to the site: https://donations.request.network/\n\nYou can check out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/request-network-req/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Request Network.","developer_score":42.414,"id":"request-network","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1031/large/Request_icon.png?1550832088","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1031/small/Request_icon.png?1550832088","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1031/thumb/Request_icon.png?1550832088"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2137740,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a","https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a"],"homepage":["https://request.network"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/RequestNetwork/Request_SmartContracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork","twitter_screen_name":"requestnetwork"},"liquidity_score":27.318,"market_cap_rank":214,"name":"Request","public_interest_score":44.058,"symbol":"req","tickers":[{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"REQ","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]}
