  OneLedger enables you to focus building your business application through OneLedger modularization tools,
  which will communicate with OneLedger protocol using its API gateway. This mechanism will make your
  business application interact with different public and private blockchains synchronously through corresponding
  side chains implemented in OneLedger platform.


  OneLedger defines a three-layer consensus protocol to enable more effective integration of different
  blockchain applications. Business logic can be implemented by the first layer – a configurable role-based
  consensus protocol leveraging hierarchical grouping similar to the structure of Merkle Tree. The side
  chain consensus protocol can move consensus traffic from the main chain with public consensus to the
  side chain with high performance and efficiency. OneLedger block structure enables the synchronization
  and reference between the three-layer consensus.


  The company works as a cross-ledger blockchain platform for people to make exchanges through business
  methodology. Not only that, but it’s also developed using the enterprise blockchain technology solutions
  that are running across the globe like something the world has never seen. One Ledger also operates
  as a powerful consensus engine that will help people with governance, so they can rest assured their
  transactions are being completed legitimately. The SDK on the platform is also highly customizable.
  And the platform, in general, is highly scalable and reliable.


  The architecture of the One Leger is built around the focal point of building your business software
  through the One Ledger modularization tools. They are set up to communicate with One Leger’s advanced
  protocol via the unique API gateway used by the platform developers. The new method of operation is
  designed to make your business application work together with different private and public blockchains
  in synchronicity by way of side chains that work together and are implemented via the One Ledger platform.
  The platform is designed to help people in a wide range of different business models. People in finance,
  agriculture, transportation, manufacturing and just about anything else will benefit highly from the
  One Ledger protocol. It works with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>,
