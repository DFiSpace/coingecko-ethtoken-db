  Cryptocurrency is blocked in the smart contract till the signal about crediting of fiat money to the
  sellerâ€™s account is received, being transferred directly between users. Fiat money and cryptocurrency
  are not blocked on the platform, which allows us to work legally in most jurisdictions of the world.
  The commission varies from 0 to 2% and depends on the purchased package with a set of benefits. StreamDesk
  project is based on the sought-after mass service, and connection of new users will create a strong
  demand for STM tokens. Moreover, the tokens will be openly traded on the main crypto exchanges, and,
  through StreamDesk service, users will transform cryptocurrency into ordinary money as it is much more
  profitable, by ensuring access of new users to the service!
