Terawatt will create a DAO, and also a deflationary Ethereum-based, private (zk-SNARKS) currency for global payments. The DAO will be funded and used by Utility Companies, L.E.D. Sellers, Businesses, token holders, and energy customers worldwide. The DAO will act as a decentralized global mutual/insurance fund to ensure Utilities (and businesses) always have access to funding (which constantly runs out) for subsidizing L.E.D. sales to their energy customers (or for businesses upgrading to L.E.D.s).","id":"terawatt","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4180151,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x93c9291523cb95c0eb0bc379b0483f4d7fc05072","https://etherscan.io/token/0x93c9291523cb95c0eb0bc379b0483f4d7fc05072","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x93c9291523cb95c0eb0bc379b0483f4d7fc05072"],"facebook_username":"Terawatt","homepage":["https://www.terawattled.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/terawattled/daofrontend"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"TeraWattICO","twitter_screen_name":"terawatt_led"},"name":"Terawatt","symbol":"led","tickers":[{"base":"LED","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"LED","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LED","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]}
