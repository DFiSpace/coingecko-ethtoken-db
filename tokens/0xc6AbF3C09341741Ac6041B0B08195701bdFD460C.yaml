  The retail industry loses approximately $500bln USD per annum*. OSA DC reduces this waste by uniting
  producer, retailer, and consumer with its blockchain-empowered solutions, all while fixing three major
  issues that hinder the retail industry today:

  inventory tracking on the blockchain will solve the problem of overstocking or understocking which costs
  retailers $400bln USD annually*

  the blockchainâ€™s immutable ledger will provide more reliable product data and prevent business from
  abusing consumer trust

  OSA DC will cut back on product waste that results in a loss of $100 billion USD annually
