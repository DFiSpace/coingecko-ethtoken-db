  Deep Health Chain (“DHC”), a decentralized healthcare service platform, breaks away from the traditional
  facility-centered healthcare model and instead establishes a blockchain-based medical data sharing network
  that enables universal access to high-quality healthcare resources and services across the world.

  The world on average spends 9.9% of its GDP on healthcare and the U.S. even up to 17%. Medical costs
  across the world have been rising, though with poor care received by patients. For example, the misdiagnosis
  rate hovers high, and inadequate and expensive care is still a global issue.


  The combination and rapid development of various technologies, including big data, blockchain and artificial
  intelligence (AI), is making an increasingly huge difference in a wide range of sectors. The marriage
  of medical data and the above technologies is set to disrupt the existing landscape of healthcare sector
  and reshape its value distribution. DHC and its partners in the healthcare ecosystem own the medical
  data of more than 30 tertiary A-level hospitals and hundreds of other medical facilities, plus top technical
  specialists and medical experts specialized in blockchain, AI and big data. DHC is committed to building
  an autonomous public chain to address privacy protection and secure exchange of medical data and establishing
  a DHC data marketplace and app marketplace by leveraging a variety of technical solutions, such as smart
  contract, decentralized distributed storage, proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, homomorphic encryption,
  differential privacy, etc.


  Description of Token (Utility/Use Cases):


  1. DHC Token mechanism

  As DHT (Deep Health Token) is the Token issued on the DHC platform for the purpose of ensuring the effective
  operation of ecosystem and all activities in the DHC ecosystem should be linked by DHT, it is quite
  important to design a fair, just and reasonable Token mechanism.


  2. DHT incentive pool

  In the DHC system, the DHC platform produces DHTs every day, which are stored in the Token pool and
  distributed to the original data contributors. The number of Tokens in the Token pool gradually decreases
  over time. The Tokens are distributed with the algorithm model. After distribution, the remaining Tokens
  on the current day are included in the Token pool on the next day


  3. Validator node

  In the DHC ecosystem, the authenticated institutions or third parties can become the DHC chain validator
  nodes, which are responsible for the data verification and packaging of the chain and get corresponding
  remuneration of Token. However, in order to prevent the validator node from cheating to make a profit,
  each validator node should mortgage some DHTs in the system and will be subject to deduction of corresponding
  amount of Tokens in case of cheating behaviors, and the institutions will be listed in the blacklist
  until recharging DHTs where all Tokens of such institutions are deducted. Therefore, cheating is costly.

  In addition, the validator node institutions extract the original data and make data standardized, then
  develop and provide data management DAPPs to users who utilize DAPPs to contribute their data to the
  DHC data market


  4. Data contributor

  The ownership of data in the DHC ecosystem is attributed to users who can decide whether to contribute
  the data or not for specific purposes (smart contract limitation), and the user can obtain some DHT
  rewards in case of data contribution and the DHTs obtained can be used to purchase services in the application
  market. In terms of the data contributed by users, the system distributes the DHC-contributed Token
  pool on the current day in compliance with the POQ (Proof of Quality) model


  5.Data consumer

  The third institution or the developer can purchase authorized data from users through the data mart
  to carry out analytical research and application development, etc. And the purchaser needs to pay DHT
  in accordance with the scenario and quantity of the purchased data. Expenditure of Token for using data
  can be calculated by POT (Proof of Times, proving the effective times) model, through which data are
  progressively charged based on the use frequency in a certain period. Specifically, the data used more
  frequently in the period is more valuable. Therefore, the consumers need to spend more money on the
  data, and the contributors can make more gains


  6. Application developer

  The institutions or individuals capable of analysis and development can use data in the data mart to
  make analysis and development. Developed applications can be launched in the app store, available for
  users or institutions. It is also free to charge the application or restrict its application scope


  7. Application consumer

  Users or institutions can choose what they need in the app store, probably paying a certain amount of
  DHT as the service fee.

  The DHC platform uses ERC20 token of Ethereum as the Token before launch of the main chain. It switches
  to the DHT on main chain after launch of the main chain
