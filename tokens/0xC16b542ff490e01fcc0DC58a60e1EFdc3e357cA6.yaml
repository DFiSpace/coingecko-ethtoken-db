  Ice Rock Mining is here to bring bitcoin mining to the investment world. We believe bitcoin has a long
  and significant role in the new monetary system that is forming. Our goal is to raise capital and scale
  our mining business; we are currently in operation and already delivering returns to our investors.
  With Ice Rock, investors become our partners and share in the realization of profits, while assuring
  themselves a stable and passive income. Because of our efficiencies, we are able to operate on lower
  costs and thereby pass those savings on to our investors. With todayâ€™s hashrates, our ROI to investors
  is over 200% per year, and could increase if the price of bitcoin appreciates.
