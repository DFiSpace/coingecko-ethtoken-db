  Four areas of Edge computing: Device Domains (perception and control tiers), network domains (connection
  and network tiers), data domains (storage and service tiers), application domains (business and intelligence
  tiers). These four "layers" are the compute objects of the edge computer. For businesses that are unique
  at all levels, it is only necessary to deploy targeted computing power independently at the corresponding
  level. JMT uses blockchain technology for distributed hierarchical control.
