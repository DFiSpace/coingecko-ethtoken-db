description: >-
  Electronic Energy Coin (E2C) is a blockchain-based trading platform for green technology. E2C is built
  according to the ERC-20 token standards, which is used by the popular Ethereum system. This makes E2C
  compliant with most cryptocurrencies standards and protocols in the market, hence more compatible with
  most trading platforms.


  At E2C, we look to an ecological and sustainable future. Our project will build towards an energy revolution,
  a more equitable distribution of energy, and improved control over the use and transaction of energy.


  Conventionally, the energy market is dominated by large power plants, with control being centralized
  in a few people. This often results in large excessive costs for the ordinary people, such as owners
  of private enterprises who are dependent on energy.
