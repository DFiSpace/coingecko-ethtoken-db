  Bitex will launch in mid-2018 with a subset of banking services offered to customers in 8 countries
  (Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates), with
  plans for expanding its reach in the future. Services will be operated by local partners that license
  the Bitex platform as a franchise and who will register with the financial authorities in their respective
  countries. By working with local partners, who have a much better understanding of local customers and
  regulators and making available localized applications and customer support, the Bitex crypto-banking
  platform becomes the most accessible crypto-banking solution on the market.
