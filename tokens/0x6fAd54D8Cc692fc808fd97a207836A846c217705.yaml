description: "Alchemint uses smart contract to allow distributed creations of sdusd (a kind of stablecoin\
  \ dynamically pegged to USD) with the collateralization of various crypto-assets, as backed by a set\
  \ of mechanism that secures the stability of sdusd’s value. Popular digital currencies, such as BTC,\
  \ ETH and NEO, are unable to become means of payment as a result of their huge price volatility, which\
  \ to a large extent impedes the current blockchain projects getting down to earth. \n\nHaving all the\
  \ characteristics of crypto-currency, sdusd is additionally able to keep its own value stable.  Being\
  \ user-friendly, sdusd can be sent to others, used to settle prices for goods and services or held as\
  \ long-term saving.  Sdusd will also serve as an essential medium of exchange for crypto-currency trading\
  \ platforms.\n\nInitially, Alchemint’s platform supports one single type of asset to be collateralized,\
  \ which is NEO.  Subsequently, Alchemint will embrace assorted collateral assets and accept the reserve\
  \ and mortgage of tokenized traditional assets, such as gold, real estate, fund units and etc., with\
  \ a view to meeting consumer grade liquidity needs for stablecoins.\n\nDown the road, sdusd will grow\
  \ into an important value transmission tool for blockchain-based appli-cations and be applied to various\
  \ business scenarios.  In addition, sdusd will provide users with expe-rience of freedom, fairness and\
  \ swiftness in the Internet world and build up a more efficient business development system with lower\
  \ costs for crypto start-ups to boom."
