  Every single GGC is issued out of gold already purchased and held by a gold vault instead of crowdfunding
  from ideas and plans. We call our process "ICC", initial coin circulation instead of an ICO. Most of
  our competitors are issued out of ICOs with little circulation, GGC circulates on market from day one.
