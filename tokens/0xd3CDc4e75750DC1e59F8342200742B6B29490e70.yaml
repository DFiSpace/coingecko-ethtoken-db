  "The Decurian token project entails the development of a functional and modern cryptocurrency that will
  operate on the blockchain technology of Ethereum. The main goal of this project is to establish a system

  where users can challenge each other on the outcome of a sport, video game or e-sport using our token.
  The Decurian token will not depend on the current BTC price and will not be subject to itâ€™s volatility
  and

  moving average. Decurian will always have a base value because it will be tethered to a small percentage
  of precious metals and therefore will never be valued at zero.Decurian will exist on the ERC20 Main
  Net blockchain for utilizing smart contracts.
