  Augur is a trustless, decentralized platform for prediction markets. Augur is an <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>-based
  decentralized prediction market that leverages the wisdom of the crowds to create a search engine for
  the future that runs on its own token, REP. Augur allows users to create their markets for specific
  questions they may have and to profit from the trading buys while allowing users to buy positive or
  negative shares regarding the outcome of a future event.


  Prediction markets are markets created to trade the probability of an event happening. The market prices
  indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of an event happening. Predictive markets have shown
  to have been effective in accurately forecasting many results however it is still not widely used due
  to the many regulatory hurdles involved in setting up such a market. Augur aims to set up such a market
  in a decentralized manner.


  Augur is an Ethereum-based decentralized prediction market that leverages the wisdom of the crowds to
  create a search engine for the future that runs on its own token, REP. Augur allows users to create
  their markets for specific questions they may have and to profit from the trading buys while allowing
  users to buy positive or negative shares regarding the outcome of a future event. Augur REP is the gambling
  cryptocurrency. Itâ€™s the crypto token you can use to bet on sporting events, political  outcomes, economies
  and just about everything else in the prediction markets. Online gambling is a $52 billion a year industry.


  At its founding the project included Intrade founder Ron Bernstein, Robin Hanson, and Ethereum founder
  Vitalik Buterin among its advisers. In April 2015, Augur's first contract was uploaded to the Ethereum
  network.The first beta version was released in March 2016. In October 2016, all the reputation tokens
  that were for sale during the 2015 crowdfunding campaign were distributed to their owners on the live
  Ethereum network and the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex">Poloniex</a>
  and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kraken">Kraken</a>, added support for these tokens
  on their trading platforms. The project was delayed until it was launched in July 2018.
