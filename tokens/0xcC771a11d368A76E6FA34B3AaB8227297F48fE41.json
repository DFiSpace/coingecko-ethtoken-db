Medical costs across the world have been rising, though with poor care received by patients. For example, the misdiagnosis rate hovers high, and inadequate and expensive care is still a global issue.\n\nThe combination and rapid development of various technologies, including big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), is making an increasingly huge difference in a wide range of sectors. The marriage of medical data and the above technologies is set to disrupt the existing landscape of healthcare sector and reshape its value distribution. DHC and its partners in the healthcare ecosystem own the medical data of more than 30 tertiary A-level hospitals and hundreds of other medical facilities, plus top technical specialists and medical experts specialized in blockchain, AI and big data. DHC is committed to building an autonomous public chain to address privacy protection and secure exchange of medical data and establishing a DHC data marketplace and app marketplace by leveraging a variety of technical solutions, such as smart contract, decentralized distributed storage, proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, etc.\n\nDescription of Token (Utility/Use Cases):\n\n1. DHC Token mechanism\nAs DHT (Deep Health Token) is the Token issued on the DHC platform for the purpose of ensuring the effective operation of ecosystem and all activities in the DHC ecosystem should be linked by DHT, it is quite important to design a fair, just and reasonable Token mechanism.\n\n2. DHT incentive pool\nIn the DHC system, the DHC platform produces DHTs every day, which are stored in the Token pool and distributed to the original data contributors. The number of Tokens in the Token pool gradually decreases over time. The Tokens are distributed with the algorithm model. After distribution, the remaining Tokens on the current day are included in the Token pool on the next day\n\n3. Validator node\nIn the DHC ecosystem, the authenticated institutions or third parties can become the DHC chain validator nodes, which are responsible for the data verification and packaging of the chain and get corresponding remuneration of Token. However, in order to prevent the validator node from cheating to make a profit, each validator node should mortgage some DHTs in the system and will be subject to deduction of corresponding amount of Tokens in case of cheating behaviors, and the institutions will be listed in the blacklist until recharging DHTs where all Tokens of such institutions are deducted. Therefore, cheating is costly.\nIn addition, the validator node institutions extract the original data and make data standardized, then develop and provide data management DAPPs to users who utilize DAPPs to contribute their data to the DHC data market\n\n4. Data contributor\nThe ownership of data in the DHC ecosystem is attributed to users who can decide whether to contribute the data or not for specific purposes (smart contract limitation), and the user can obtain some DHT rewards in case of data contribution and the DHTs obtained can be used to purchase services in the application market. In terms of the data contributed by users, the system distributes the DHC-contributed Token pool on the current day in compliance with the POQ (Proof of Quality) model\n\n5.Data consumer\nThe third institution or the developer can purchase authorized data from users through the data mart to carry out analytical research and application development, etc. And the purchaser needs to pay DHT in accordance with the scenario and quantity of the purchased data. Expenditure of Token for using data can be calculated by POT (Proof of Times, proving the effective times) model, through which data are progressively charged based on the use frequency in a certain period. Specifically, the data used more frequently in the period is more valuable. Therefore, the consumers need to spend more money on the data, and the contributors can make more gains\n\n6. Application developer\nThe institutions or individuals capable of analysis and development can use data in the data mart to make analysis and development. Developed applications can be launched in the app store, available for users or institutions. It is also free to charge the application or restrict its application scope\n\n7. Application consumer\nUsers or institutions can choose what they need in the app store, probably paying a certain amount of DHT as the service fee.\nThe DHC platform uses ERC20 token of Ethereum as the Token before launch of the main chain. It switches to the DHT on main chain after launch of the main chain","developer_score":0.0,"id":"deep-health-chain","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5227/large/deep-health-chain-logo.jpg?1547040703","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5227/small/deep-health-chain-logo.jpg?1547040703","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5227/thumb/deep-health-chain-logo.jpg?1547040703"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["http://explorer.51ddkan.com/#/home","https://etherscan.io/token/0xcc771a11d368a76e6fa34b3aab8227297f48fe41"],"chat_url":["https://deephealthchain.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzU0Mzg2MjU3NjQ4LTQ3YzFkNWQ1ZWY0YjZmMzhlZDUwMTc4MTE4ZmQ4MTFjYTA3Njc0NTk0ODUyODcyMjY1ZDc1NzQyOTcxMzQwMTU","https://i.beechat.io/DeepHealthChain"],"facebook_username":"DHC.DeepHealth","homepage":["https://dh.life/index.html"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"DeepHealthChain","twitter_screen_name":"DHC_DeepHealth"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":5631,"name":"Deep Health Chain","public_interest_score":24.866,"symbol":"dht","tickers":[]}
