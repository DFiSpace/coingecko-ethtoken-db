  Based on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> network and the ConsenSys
  venture production studio, SingularDTV relies on a tokenized ecosystem using a local cryptocurrency
  called SNGLS to help artists and creators benefit from transparent media production and distribution.
  SingularDTV is a blockchain entertainment studio laying the foundation for a decentralized entertainment
  industry. Building the future of rights management, project funding, and peer-to-peer distribution,
  SingularDTV’s platform empowers artists and creators with powerful tools to manage projects from development
  to distribution.


  The entire concept behind SingularDTV is a kind of “entertainment studio”, which offers artists and
  creators of media content a large platform with many programs and tools that can develop and market
  their products there. The company’s concept is based on 11 modules, some of which are already available
  as features on the platform, but some of which will not be released until 2018 or 2019. The modules
  are: Tokit, Decentralized Exchange, Codex, Launch Pad, Legal Repository, Production Service/Crew, Equipment
  Rental, Talent Management, Marketing, Union Interface and EtherVision.


  The company was founded by Arie Levy-Cohen, Kim Jackson, Zach Lebeau and Joseph Lubin.The founders have
  the vision to create an entertainment platform that offers artists and producers a good marketing time
  on a decentralized basis.They are competing with streaming services such as Netflix or Youtube. The
  company will even publish the first specially produced television series on the platform in the autumn
  of 2017. This project is led by Kim Jackson, who is also a producer and president of “Evotion Media”.


  Singular-DTV wants to gather a total of $7.5 million. In order to do so, a crowdsale which will last
  for a month will be held. During this time 500 million SNGLS tokens will be up for sale at a fixed rate
  of 0.00125 ETH per SNGL during the first 10 days, and will drop by 12.5% every 4 days until it reaches
  50% (in 12 days). These funds will be used to complete the "Singular" tv show, launch the S-DTV Documentary
  Division, buy a stake in the Ujo rights management platform and to develop the TVOD distribution portal.
  A minimum of 34m SNGLS must be sold, otherwise, the project will be canceled and all the investments
  will be returned.  Since the issuance of tokens takes place on the Ethereum network, you'll only be
  able to invest in the crowd sale using Ether. This is done by sending ETH to a special smart contract
  wallet address, that in turn issues and sends you the newly created SNGLS tokens. This can be done using
  any wallet, but in order to be able to see and transfer your tokens, you'll need to use the Mist Browser
  or the S-DTV Light Wallet.
