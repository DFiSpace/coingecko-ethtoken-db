Tapping on the protocol, developers can build payment flows and financial apps, including instant token swap services, erc20 payments, and innovative financial dapps - helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere.\n\nKyber Network maintains liquidity through the dynamic reserve pool. The pool contains all of the Reserve Entities in the system. Having multiple entities in the pool prevents monopolization and keeps exchange rates competitive. When a user requests an exchange, the Kyber smart contract makes the exchange through the Reserve Entity with the best exchange rate for the user. By allowing external Reserve Entities, Kyber Network prevents centralization and opens the door to low-volume token listings. External reserves may be fine with taking on the risk of storing less popular tokens that the Kyber reserves don\u2019t list.\nTo prevent bad actors in the reserve pool, Kyber Network has few safeguards. The network will flag any exchange rate for special approval that\u2019s greatly outside the norm. To protect funds in a public reserve, Kyber makes all exchanges using them available through a transparent fund management model.\n\nThe Kyber team is impressive. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loiluu/\">Loi Luu</a>, Yaron Velner, and Victor Tran are the founders behind the project. Luu previously created Oyente, the first open-source security analyzer for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> contracts, and cofounded SmartPool, a decentralized mining pool project. Velner has been active in the Ethereum bug bounty program, and Tran is also a lead developer at SmartPool. The team has a well-rounded advisory board with the most notable member being <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitalik-buterin-267a7450\">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum wunderkind. In August 2017, Kyber successfully launched their testnet beta. They plan on releasing their live product in Q1 this year in which you\u2019ll be able to trade between Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. The project has an extensive list of partners including <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/request-network\">Request Network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wax\">Wax</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storm\">Storm</a>.\n\nBecause it\u2019s an ERC20 token, you can store KNC in any wallet with ERC20 support. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect\">MyEtherWallet</a> is the most popular online option. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask\">MetaMask</a> works as well. Many investors choose to use a hardware wallet for additional security. You can\u2019t go wrong with either the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review\">Trezor</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ledger-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-review\">Ledger</a> wallet as both supports KNC.","developer_score":63.737,"id":"kyber-network","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/947/large/kyber-logo.png?1547034806","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/947/small/kyber-logo.png?1547034806","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/947/thumb/kyber-logo.png?1547034806"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200","https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200"],"homepage":["https://kyber.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/kybernetwork/KyberWallet"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kybernetwork/","telegram_channel_identifier":"officialkybernetwork","twitter_screen_name":"kybernetwork"},"liquidity_score":50.624,"market_cap_rank":103,"name":"Kyber Network","public_interest_score":30.166,"symbol":"knc","tickers":[{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"bitkub","name":"Bitkub"},"target":"THB"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"CoinExchange.io"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"credoex","name":"CredoEx"},"target":"CREDO"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KNC","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"USDT"}]}
