  An open source, smart contract-based stablecoin True financial interoperability requires a price stable
  means of value exchange. Zethereum technology for fiat-backed stablecoins brings stability to crypto.
  The initial implementation is USD Coin (USDC), an ERC-20 token creating possibilities in payments, lending,
  investing, trading and trade finance â€” and the ecosystem will grow as other fiat currency tokens are
  added.


  As more goods and services are tokenized, smart contract platforms will become fundamental building
  blocks of value exchange. Zethereum open-source and transparent stablecoin framework allows fiat to
  interact with smart contracts, giving developers a viable way to use real world currencies in blockchain
  applications.


  Zethereum stablecoins are issued by regulated and licensed financial institutions that maintain full
  reserves of the equivalent fiat currency. Issuers are required to regularly report USD reserve holdings,
  and that information will be made available upon request.
