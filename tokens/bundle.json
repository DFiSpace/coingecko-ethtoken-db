[{"address":"0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376","description":"TrueUSD provides its token holders regular attestations of escrowed balances, full collateral, and also the legal protection against misappropriating underlying USD. The team believes that TrueUSD will be able to come up with the stable trading instrument for the traders of cryptocurrency that has been long-awaited. This will allow the businesses and consumers to use the digital currency as a medium of an exchange. The goal of the TrueUSD team was to build a coin that is stable and which can be used and trusted by them too. TrustToken is a platform that creates the tokens backed by assets that can easily be purchased and sold all around the world. The first asset token of TrustToken is TrueUSD, which is a stable coin and can be redeemed 1-for-1 for US dollars. TrustToken have partnered with registered fiduciaries and banks for holding the funds securely backed by TrueUSD tokens. To increase the amount of security, fiduciaries, and banks directly handle all the funds. Escrowed funds do not give access to the TrueUSD system.\n\nTrueUSD works with various trust companies which already manage around billions of dollars. Just pass an AML/KYC check, send USD to a trust company with an agreement of escrow. When the funds get verified, their API tells the smart contract of TUSD to mint an equal amount of TUSD to your public <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> address.\n\nThe USD funds are regularly verified in scheduled attestations by a very much trusted auditing firm. USD funds are kept safely in a third party account, that is escrow accounts, wherein TrustToken does not hold any direct access to the funds and cannot abscond with them even if they wish to. The token burning and minting system makes sure that every TUSD token is backed by 1 USD.\n\nA mandatory check of AML/KYC makes sure that TUSD keeps shady people away from the entire project. TUSD makes faster transactions in low transaction fees. Even though TUSD is a unique offering, it is most likely overshadowed by its bigger competitors - Tether. While TUSD arguably offers more security and features, it may be losing the marketing battle. This is not to say that the situation will remain the same. With more crypto investors joining the market every day, the good times for TUSD may be on their way.","id":"true-usd","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x0000000000085d4780b73119b644ae5ecd22b376","https://etherscan.io/token/0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376"],"facebook_username":"TrustToken","homepage":["https://www.trusttoken.com/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.trusttoken.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/trusttoken/trueUSD"]},"twitter_screen_name":"TrustToken"},"name":"TrueUSD","symbol":"tusd","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x001F0aA5dA15585e5b2305DbaB2bac425ea71007","description":"IPSX will be a crucial component for the next layer of the web.

The protocol limits the need for (and influence of) third parties like advertisers and centralized publisher conglomerates. The protocol aims to support independent newsrooms initially focused on producing high-quality local, international, investigative and policy journalism. In time, we envision a vast ecosystem of journalists, citizens and developers building products and services dedicated to powering sustainable journalism throughout the world.\n\nCivil\u2019s cryptoeconomic model seeks to enable a more direct, transparent relationship between journalists and citizens, while using blockchain to also strengthen protections for journalists against censorship and intellectual property violations. The goal of Civil is to create a sustainable, global marketplace for journalism that is free from manipulative ads, misinformation and outside influence. Civil will differ from current media companies, both platforms and publishers, where a centralized operator controls the distribution of content to the public. By improving transparency and autonomy through a decentralized approach, Civil aims to strengthen trust between citizens and traditional news reporting, creating a renewed appreciation for the value of financially supporting journalism directly.\n\nActivity on the Civil protocol will be mediated through the Ethereum blockchain and a community of consumers, content creators, fact checkers and publishers, who work together to decide which newsrooms to organize and the types of content published on the network. Rather than a given platform or publisher dictating the content its readers can consume, a decentralized network of people curates newsrooms and content.\n\nIn order to achieve Civil\u2019s decentralized goal, activity on the platform will be managed by an Ethereum blockchain-based token, CVL.","id":"civil","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x01fa555c97d7958fa6f771f3bbd5ccd508f81e22","https://etherscan.io/token/0x01fa555c97d7958fa6f771f3bbd5ccd508f81e22","https://ethplorerio/address/0x01fa555c97d7958fa6f771f3bbd5ccd508f81e22"],"facebook_username":"JoinCivil","homepage":["https://civil.co/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"join_civil","twitter_screen_name":"join_civil"},"name":"Civil","symbol":"CVL","tickers":[{"base":"CVL","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x01b3Ec4aAe1B8729529BEB4965F27d008788B0EB","description":"Digital Assets Power Play Ltd.

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE\u2019s platform.\n\nONE is divided into two parts:\n\nCommunity-owned\n51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\n\nBIG token holders owned\n49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\n\nTrade cryptos in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. As incentive, you will receive 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee rebate in the form of ONEs.\nBIG tokens stored on BigONE platform will automatically be airdropped ONEs.\nHold ONEs, Share All Platform Trading Fee\n\nEveryday at 00:00 UTC+8, BigONE will take a snapshot according to the current ONE balance on the platform. All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula = number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\n\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d or \u201cReferral-Mining\u201d or \u201cAirdrop to BIG token holders\u201d until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\n\n\u3010Trade-Mining\u3011\n\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the platform will calculate all trading fees occurred in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section during the last 24 hours (from the previous 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) and unlock equivalent worth of ONEs using the average price of ONE on the same day. On the following day\u2019s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section in the previous day.\n\n\u3010Referral-Mining\u3011\n\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform\u2019s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users\u2019 tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\n\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\n\n\u3010Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders\u3011\n\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders\u2019 according to the formula: [Previous day\u2019s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\n\n\u3010Friendly Tips\u3011\n\nAs soon as the new \u201cTrade-mining\u201d rule applies and 100% of BigONE's revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\n\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\n\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks. Any investment decisions should be made with caution.\n\n\n\u4ec0\u4e48\u662fONE?\n\nONE \u662f BigONE

is an international cryptocurrency exchange based out of Hong Kong that currently supports the trading of 210 digital assets. What\u2019s unique about KuCoin is that they share 50% of their overall trading fee revenue with users holding their exchange-based token. In a similar fashion to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, KuCoin offers relatively low tradings fees and incentives for holding (or trading) its native cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, the founders started researching blockchain tech and went further to build the technical architecture for KuCoin in 2013. 4 years later, the exchange launched with the ultimate goal of \u201cbecoming one of the top 10 worldwide hottest exchange platform[s]\u201d by 2019.\n\nAs stated on their official website which lists 12 core members, \u201cKucoin aims at providing users digital asset transaction and exchange services which are even more safe and convenient, integrating premium assets worldwide, and constructing state of the art transaction platform\u201d. CEO and founder, Michael Gam, is a former technical expert at Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group. He was also a senior partner at Internet giants like MikeCRM and KF5.COM. OO, Eric Don, is referred to as a \u201csenior Internet researcher, systems architect, and Internet industry star\u201d. He is also stated to be the CTO and senior partner of IT companies including YOULIN.COM, KITEME, and REINOT. However, it\u2019s unclear if these websites actually exist as they did not show in a Google search or when entering the website domains.  According to his LinkedIn, he is currently CTO at Youlin Network Technologies, yet there is no mention of KITEME or REINOT.\n\nWith its growing user base and increasing number of cryptocurrencies being offered, KuCoin may be set up for a strong run in the markets. KuCoin Shares volume is expected to grow as the daily trading volume on KuCoin, hence, trading fees collection grows & thus, the size of dividend payout grows. This can lure investors to hold KCS token which may even increase its value. KuCoin faces stiff competition from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex\">OKEx</a>, but it expects to continue to grow its community exponentially as it is being projected to be one among the top 5 exchanges in the world.","id":"kucoin-shares","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x039b5649a59967e3e936d7471f9c3700100ee1ab","https://etherscan.io/token/0x039b5649a59967e3e936d7471f9c3700100ee1ab","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x039b5649a59967e3e936d7471f9c3700100ee1ab"],"homepage":["https://www.kucoin.com/#/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin","twitter_screen_name":"kucoincom"},"name":"KuCoin Shares","symbol":"kcs","tickers":[{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"biki","name":"Biki"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PRL","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"TKY","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"GAS","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"ETC","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"KCS","market":{"identifier":"oex","name":"OEX"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0x03A6d45820Edb4e66e41Ece0Dc96170E875A1d16","description":"Microbyte is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.

Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.\n\nZilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too.\n\nZiliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It\u2019s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.","id":"zilliqa","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2367256,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x05f4a42e251f2d52b8ed15e9fedaacfcef1fad27","https://etherscan.io/token/0x05f4a42e251f2d52b8ed15e9fedaacfcef1fad27","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x05f4a42e251f2d52b8ed15e9fedaacfcef1fad27","https://explorer.zilliqa.com","https://viewblock.io/zilliqa"],"homepage":["https://www.zilliqa.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa","https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library","https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-Wallet","https://github.com/Zilliqa/scilla"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/zilliqa/","telegram_channel_identifier":"zilliqachat","twitter_screen_name":"zilliqa"},"name":"Zilliqa","symbol":"zil","tickers":[{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"biki","name":"Biki"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ZIL","market":{"identifier":"zgtop","name":"ZG.TOP"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x06147110022B768BA8F99A8f385df11a151A9cc8","description":"TokenStars is the talent management platform (tennis), that connects stars, fans and advertisers.\n\u2022 Platform is launched: 6 modules are live on blockchain.\n\u2022 10,000 registered users on the platform (additionally to the ICO participants) and 6,000 tokenholders.\n\nProject solves 4 major problems of the industry:\n1.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\n\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\n\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as the base cryptocoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en\">Trezor Hardware Wallet</a> are also wallets that supports district0x.\n\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\n\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders\u2019 rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs.","id":"district0x","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2009966,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x0abdace70d3790235af448c88547603b945604ea","https://etherscan.io/token/0x0abdace70d3790235af448c88547603b945604ea","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0abdace70d3790235af448c88547603b945604ea"],"homepage":["https://district0x.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/district0x/name-bazaar"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/district0x","twitter_screen_name":"district0x"},"name":"district0x","symbol":"dnt","tickers":[{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"ethex","name":"Ethex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"3F24CA13-F371-484B-8B07-15F1C74D2DFD","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"3F24CA13-F371-484B-8B07-15F1C74D2DFD","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"thetokenstore","name":"Token.Store"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DNT","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x0AfFa06e7Fbe5bC9a764C979aA66E8256A631f02","description":"Polybius Bank project will operate on the principles of an Open API, employing reputable innovations and services within the framework of payment and data processing industry.

The Basic Attention Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque.\n\nBasic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data. Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates into rewards for publishers.\n\nA user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements, is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.\n\nCreated back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla.

In this virtual world, you purchase plots of land that you can later traverse, build upon, and monetize. There\u2019s no limit to what you can do. It\u2019s the first digital platform that\u2019s completely owned by its users. Similar to games like Skyrim and Fallout, Decentraland is an all-immersive virtual universe. However, instead of playing on a 2-dimensional screen, you participate in a 3-dimensional world. It seems to be the logical next step before creating full-blown AI-based games in the physical space \u00e0 la Westworld. Similar groupings on LAND comprise Districts. Districts are basically communities that revolve around a shared theme. For example, there may be a District just for crypto enthusiasts with cryptocurrency apps and services.\n\nThe Decentraland team is led by Ari Meilich (Project Lead) and Esteban Ordano (Tech Lead). Ordano previously worked at <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/\">Bitpay</a> as a software engineer and founded Smart Contract Solutions, Inc. Both founders have also worked together in creating Stremium and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcore\">Bitcore</a>. Decentraland has been around for longer than you may think. The team hit their first development milestone, Stone Age, in June 2015. This was a simple, pixelated grid that allocated pixels to users through a proof-of-work algorithm. Most recently, they held a Terraform Event in which they sold LAND in the new, 3D world. The team has also partnered with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x\">district0x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon\">Aragon</a>, and imToken to provide some of their services.\n\nMANA is the token used to buy lands in Decentraland. The Blockchain platform can be incorporated in order to buy or sell the various digital assets available in the virtual world. An unclaimed land would have the same market pricing on every exchange possible and precisely the developers are on a hunt for such since as they can build on top of it, and attract lot of popularity. However, one must keep in mind that the land parcels are different from them and each one of them varies according to the various market conditions of that time. Mana can be a great investment and can be bought by trading and with other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, or any other prominent cryptocurrency and on some of the most notable cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/huobi\">Huobi</a> are two of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that one can suggest for trading Mana tokens.\n\nThe Decentraland coin isn\u2019t a minable cryptocurrency as it is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, unlike Bitcoin and other similar currencies. So users looking to engage in some Decentraland mining will be disappointed. Instead, it was sold during token sales and is now being traded on exchanges.","id":"decentraland","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1968414,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942"],"homepage":["https://decentraland.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/decentraland/cli","https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-dapps","https://github.com/decentraland/land-auction","https://github.com/decentraland/mana","https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland","twitter_screen_name":"decentraland"},"name":"Decentraland","symbol":"mana","tickers":[{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MNA","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"7D6F7AD2-DF80-4328-8EAF-093743B70F30","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"7D6F7AD2-DF80-4328-8EAF-093743B70F30","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"oax","name":"OAX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"prixbit","name":"Prixbit"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"saturn_network","name":"Saturn Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x0F72714B35a366285Df85886A2eE174601292A17","description":"1SG is a stable coin issued by Mars Blockchain, aiming to overcome the problem of today's cryptocurrency.

The first tier is the traditional token structure that participates in exchange transactions. The second tier uses the first tier token structure, launches a timed auction and float aiming at fiat money, mainly to solve the problem of token volatility, reduce volatility which is easy billing. INT will build a framework for machines and devices, and create a token, which will be used to facilitate the resource exchange between nodes and heterogeneous links (different nodes may create independent internal links). For example, a node may make a request and pay corresponding tokens to request other nodes (or links) to provide power, network, data, service and other possible resources. In addition, through zero knowledge proof (specific improvement as necessary), optional masking may be conducted to protect user privacy and improve security.\n\nThe Internet of things has developed rapidly in the last a few years, however, concerns have been raised for the standards of communication and data exchanges among manufacturers, the interests of manufacturers, user privacy, as well as fragmented model constraint on the overall IoT development. It is expected that more than 25 billion nodes will be connected on the internet in year 2020, however, if the interconnection within the whole network is not smooth, the fragmented Internet of Things would not fully realize value of the nodes. Without defining a common set of protocol standards, seeking support from individual manufacturers is but inefficient and costly. Through decentralized and economy driven methods, it is a new way to make standards for device interconnection. INT is the acronym for Internet Network Token. INT attempts to build a scheme that allows data and resources to flow freely within the network and to ensure user privacy in untrusted and decentralized machine federations.\n\nINTchain is a fundamental application platform of blockchain for promoting the ecological evolution of the IoT. From the perspective of the evolution of the IoT structure, INTchain is the new generation of bottom-up created system of IoT and blockchain.

The protocol permits rights holders to define rules across the ticketing supply-chain - including promoters, venues primary / secondary agents - to which everyone must adhere.\n\nTHE AVENTUS TOKEN (AVT)\nIt is essential for aligning the economic incentives in the secure and transparent network to ensure fraudulent behaviour is identified and eliminated.\n\nAVT is used by the network in 3 key ways:\n1. Voting on the legitimacy of events in the protocol\nA means to prevent spamming in the network, and to ensure that all entities across the ticket supply chain, who will be interacting with the inventory, can contribute to the due diligence process, which is currently undertaken by a single entity.\n\n2. Creating a token-curated registry of legitimate applications\nUsing the protocol in order that ticketing rights holders and consumers have a single source of truth for verifying that the ticketing application in question is using the protocol legitimately and not circumventing rules via off-chain fees and terms and conditions.\n\n3. Facilitating the non-deterministic matching of buyers and sellers of tickets in the secondary market\nBy using proof of stake-like mechanisms. This is essential for preventing secondary market participants from circumventing the rules imposed by the rights holder, leading to unregulated resale.","id":"aventus","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1955231,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x0d88ed6e74bbfd96b831231638b66c05571e824f","https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d88ed6e74bbfd96b831231638b66c05571e824f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0d88ed6e74bbfd96b831231638b66c05571e824f"],"facebook_username":"AventusPF","homepage":["https://aventus.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AventusSystems/aventus-dapp-proposals","https://github.com/AventusSystems/bronze-protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Aventus","twitter_screen_name":"AventusSystems"},"name":"Aventus","symbol":"avt","tickers":[{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x0d9E614937A308438337A2999Acf64Fc86bF098a","description":"Xor Satellite Avatar of Trade United Recursive Neuroseed\nBenefit Line Algorithm Crypto Keep Transaction","id":"saturn-black","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/saturn-black"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5075635,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d9e614937a308438337a2999acf64fc86bf098a"],"facebook_username":"saturnatomic","homepage":["https://saturn.black/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"saturnblack","twitter_screen_name":"saturn_twitt"},"name":"Saturn Black","symbol":"xsat","tickers":[{"base":"XSAT","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"XSAT","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x0dF721639CA2F7fF0E1F618b918A65FFB199AC4E","description":"Howdoo is a revolutionary new messaging and social media platform that offers greater choice and control to users.

The fact that scalability isn\u2019t just the giant elephant in the room, it\u2019s that elephant that hastaken over the room. They are slow. Security \u2013 one needs to look no further than the recent events of not just (Initial Coin Offerings) ICO\u2019s being hacked but exchanges, wallets and entire systems as well.

Greg is the Co-founder, President and Member of the Board of Directors of The RChain Cooperative. Previously he was the Principal Architect of Microsoft's BizTalk Process Orchestration, Principal Architect of Microsoft's Highwire offering as well as Principal Architect of ATM Network management solution for ATT/NCR and Co- designer and developer of MCC's Rosette/ESS technology. No discussion about Greg would be complete without mentioning his unwavering passion/devotion (understatement) to the environment. he Co-op is the organization that develops the open-source RChain platform software. It\u2019s an open and community-driven initiative with multiple communication channels through which all are welcome to participate. The Co-op is dependent on participation from its members. This will be crucial for governance, innovation and adoption.\n\nRhain has cooperatively <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/rchain\">sold $15 million</a> worth of RHOC (valued at $0.20 each at the time) during its sale. The current iteration of RChain RHOC is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

Owndata is a crypto marketplace for data sellers and buyers. You can earn money as tokens by using our platform to share your data. Owndata provides sophisticated tools for sharing and managing the data with the targeted platform / user base.\n\nHow Owndata Works?\n1. Collection of Data\nSite Owners/Editors have to sign up and get a Owndata user account in order to register their websites to OwnData Blockchain Platform. Owndata generates a unique pixel code (unique cookie) for each website in return. The addition of this unique cookie to a web site, immediately enables the collection of visitors\u2019 data.\n\n2. Segmentation & Profilisation of Data\nThanks to the user-friendly interface, Owndata users can flexibly segment the collected visitors\u2019 data however they (or the buyer) would like to take. Besides, it also allows the users to integrate their own algorithm for a deeper profilisation & retargeting. Such a flexibility paves the way to automatically tokenize and sell the segmented data to buyers on the OwnData exchange platform.\n\nOwndata is for content owners, website owners and editors, application developers, advertisers, publishers, data suppliers, data exchanges, ad networks, DSPs, DMPs and more!\n\n1. Digital Advertisement - Digital advertising includes promotional advertisements and messages delivered through email, social media websites, online advertising on search engines, banner ads on mobile or Web sites and affiliates programs.\n\n2. TV Ads - Television advertisements have the advantage of sight, sound, movement and colour to persuade a customer to buy from you. They are particularly useful if you need to demonstrate how your product or service works.\n\n3. Print Ads - If an advertisement is printed on paper, be it newspapers, magazines, newsletters, booklets, flyers, direct mail, or anything else that would be considered a portable printed medium, then it usually comes under the banner of print advertising\n\n4. Near Future - Owndata plans to use data exchange not only on Digital, Media or Print platforms, but on all of the platforms that needs data, such as Telecommunications, Textile, Medical, etc...","id":"owndata","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@owndata","https://steemit.com/@owndata"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2996349,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x170b275ced089fffaebfe927f445a350ed9160dc","https://etherscan.io/address/0x170b275ced089fffaebfe927f445a350ed9160dc","https://etherscan.io/token/0x170b275ced089fffaebfe927f445a350ed9160dc"],"facebook_username":"owndata","homepage":["https://owndata.network"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/owndata/owndata-token"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"owndata_network","twitter_screen_name":"owndata_coin"},"name":"OWNDATA","symbol":"own","tickers":[{"base":"OWN","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OWN","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OWN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OWN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x171D750d42d661B62C277a6B486ADb82348c3Eca","description":"Omnitude is a radical concept in blockchain eco-systems.

Xpense combines image recognition technology based on blockchain to store user consumption data and behavior data. Xpense is built by face recognition technology and big data AI algorithm. Globally unified consumer value assessment system and user smart consumer passports. Xpense \u2013 extracting value from individual consumption and consumer behavior. Xpense will start a revolution on offline consumer experience and attract more users returning to brick and mortar stores.\n\nMining through facial recognition\nThe age of living off your face has come! Consumers can be rewarded tokens by scanning their faces at the offline stores which join Xpense platform program. Tokens can be converted into cash on third-party market or exchanged for all sorts of goods and services from the stores.\n\nMaking shopping full of fun\nXpense itself or stores on the platform can launch various shopping tasks based on facial recognition. After the completion of these tasks, consumers will be rewarded with token. These game-like tasks will reshape the offline consumption experience and make shopping much more interesting.\n\nKYC Capability\nUnder traditional business model, offline stores are not able to obtain the background information of each new customer, so targeted selling can not be achieved. While stores joined Xpense are empowered with the KYC (Know Your Customer) capability, therefore they can easily acquire the consumption portrait and other information of every client who has visited their stores. This is essential for them to improve the Price per Customer and success rate of sales.\n\nHelping stores win more customers\nJoining Xpense enables stores to access consumption portraits of the people nearby and push precise marketing information to them. This will tremendously improve stores\u2019 ability to gain more customers because the people nearby are the most likely potential customers.\n\nDesign of Xpense consumption & behavior data platform\nThrough the use of blockchain technology, Xpense will record all consumption and behavioral data involved by initially recording data on the side chain or off the chain and finally writing data into the backbone of Xpense data management chain. This is to ensure its growth comes from the records of consumption and behavioral data and avoid alteration or falsification. In the future, with the blockchain distributed storage technology getting more mature, the backbone of Xpense data management chain will also be transferred or stored on blockchain distributed storage. For truly achieving decentralization, we have adopted the following technologies.\n\n1.Blockchain based distributed ledger technology\n2.Side- chain and cross-chain trading technology\n3.DPOS consensus algorithm\n4.Smart AI video recognition technology","id":"xpense","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x17c8d8b7659141273a1c2223030c89b96713a44a"],"homepage":["http://www.xpense.io/"]},"name":"Xpense","symbol":"xps","tickers":[{"base":"XPS","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"XPS","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x17e67d1CB4e349B9CA4Bc3e17C7DF2a397A7BB64","description":"Freyrchain devotes itself to building the first blockchain-based collection authentication platform worldwide.

Hashpower will base on the technical characteristic to build a decentralized hash power resource shared platform which is open, fair, transparent and covenant-lite for users and provide better service connected with rich industry experience for global users at the same time. Based on the hash power system with open source and its own mining infrastructure, hash power Coin has provided node users around the world with mine construction, power lease, mine operation, equipment procurement, computational investment, digital asset trading, circulation, exchange and other services.\n\nBy reducing the mining costs, such as the use of big data, cloud mining, CDN network of the entire network of computer room networks, hash power contract mechanism, the more nation-wide mining services based on HPC digital assets has been constructed. The basic logic is as follows:\n\n1. Low-cost electricity power resources control is uesd to ensure steady earnings of project investment.\nCurrently, mining digital currencies in blockchain requires a lot of resources, especially electric power resources. Too much consumption has caused policy makers in many countries to take drastic measures against mining. Hash power Coin estimated the electric power cost of many countries, and finally selected the United States, Russia, and Sweden as the preferred overseas layout countries, and guaranteed steady earnings of project investment by controlling low-cost electric power resource channels.\n\n2. Layout in multiple countries to avoid policy risks of single country\nBlockchain as an emerging technology, each country has invested a lot of enthusiasm to the blockchain, however, different countries have shown different attitudes to the digital currency of the blockchain and formulated different policies, both of which are unstable. Hash power Coin took into account the legal risks involved and adopted a multinational development strategy to avoid the risk of project termination arising from a country\u2019s policies. We have 3 million square meters of factory buildings to transform and build the machine room in Russia, and have met the indicators of natural gas power generation, so we can generate electricity for own use with 1.4 million kilowatts, the power plant now has 300,000 kilowatts of natural gas.\n\n3. Multi-modal mining investment combines POW hash power layout with POS node layout\nAt present, there are two mining modes\u2014POW hash power layout and POS node layout. POW algorithm is proof of work algorithm. The proof of work is from the economics, which is an effective economic strategy proposed by two economists firstly in 1993 to prevent the abuse of services or resources. This type of hash power layout method rewards miners based on their contribution to mining, while the latter, POS node. layout is a model generates a new digital asset for the node based on the amount and time of the digital asset that the node holds. Hash power Coin provides mining services with ASIC, GPU, CPU, lPFS, and CDN bandwidth mining. Users can independently select the mining model through the hash power Coin. At the same time, hash power Coin plans to lay out ETH nodes in advance and will provide users with ETH-to-POS services in the future.\n\n4.Network of core labs\nHash power Coin adopts the network of core labs. Local cache acceleration is set up in different regions, which improves the access speed of different nodes and greatly improves the stability of the above mining nodes. Anti-attack cluster, with widely distributed CDN nodes and intelligent redundancy mechanisms between nodes, effectively prevents hackers from invading and reduces the impact of various D.D.o.S attacks\non websites, while ensuring better service quality.\n\n5. Computing power trading platform docking the main mining pool and mine field.\nHash power Coin solves the practical problems of mining and opens up the road between ordinary users and high-quality mine fields, so that more ordinary users can enjoy the benefits of increased hash power. The hash power trading platform of hash power Coin is easy to operate and safe, enabling more people interested in the blockchain to participate in the global digital asset allocation and get diversified difital assets in return.\n\n6.Hash power contract\nWith the improvement of the blockchain of mainstream digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the mining power is becoming more and more concentrated, and the difficulty in mining is increasing. It is under this background that the hash power Coin came into being. Therefore, intuitively speaking, the hash power Coin is a cloud hash power contract for miners, especially small and medium-sized miners, or for those who lack the infrastructure for mining digital currency. The so- called cloud hash power contract is the transformation of traditional single node mining behavior into joint mining, it eliminates a series of tedious deployments of mining, the purchase of a force contract is equal to the purchase of computing power. Mining can be achieved quickly and easily, and holding a contract represents owning a share of cloud hash power in the entire project. Users can obtain the corresponding digital assets generated by mining in accordance with their own hash power contracts. In addition, through interchange of the HPC digital assets that are originally from hash power Coin, the participants can transfer or exchange contracts, and choose to participate in or withdraw from the project according to the voluntary principle.","id":"hash-power-capital","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@powerhash"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a0c31837edb132a9312841b9527e6307db13509","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1a0c31837edb132a9312841b9527e6307db13509"],"facebook_username":"power.hash.5","homepage":["http://hashpower.vip"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"HashPowerVip","twitter_screen_name":"power_hash"},"name":"Hash Power Capital","symbol":"hpc","tickers":[{"base":"HPC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HPC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HPC","market":{"identifier":"hb_top","name":"Hb.top"},"target":"USDE"}]},{"address":"0x1A66E09F7DccC10eAe46e27cfA6B8d44a50dF1E7","description":"The mission of the PRASM project is to help people become better mentally and physically themselves.

The project offers a network, which we\u2019ll discuss soon, that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges. That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls \u201cSmart Tokens.\u201d Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn\u2019t so much an issue for top coins like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven\u2019t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.\n\nBancor\u2019s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn\u2019t call for an exchange of tokens with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain\u2019s protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert back and forth between those reserves as users request it.\n\nThe Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation that\u2019s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos\">Tezos (XTZ)</a>.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens\u2019 built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens\u2019 smart contracts always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible for balancing a Smart Token\u2019s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token\u2019s total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios, known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps.\"","id":"bancor","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1789222,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c"],"facebook_username":"bancor","homepage":["https://www.bancor.network/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.bancor.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts","https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts_eos"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor","telegram_channel_identifier":"bancor","twitter_screen_name":"BancorNetwork"},"name":"Bancor Network Token","symbol":"bnt","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x1F9232E7F1318Abf91366e6081d57Fa3C1bcdE88","description":"LEML owners can achieve wealth growth by utilizing it in artificial intelligence and cultural capital markets.

The AppCoins project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app. Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over 230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications.\n\nAppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their games or apps in the app store.The \u201cAppCoin\u201d ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating the return of the investment to the developers.\nMost industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.\n\nOnce the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to good returns for investors.\n\nAppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident that the returns of the AppCoins\u2019 solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them. However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.","id":"appcoins","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2280664,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x1a7a8bd9106f2b8d977e08582dc7d24c723ab0db","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a7a8bd9106f2b8d977e08582dc7d24c723ab0db","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1a7a8bd9106f2b8d977e08582dc7d24c723ab0db"],"facebook_username":"AppCoinsOfficial","homepage":["https://appcoins.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Aptoide/AppCoins"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppcoinsProtocol","twitter_screen_name":"AppCoinsProject"},"name":"AppCoins","symbol":"appc","tickers":[{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"C083156D-A31C-480E-98C9-EC647A435107","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"C083156D-A31C-480E-98C9-EC647A435107","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"tokenomy","name":"Tokenomy"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"tokenomy","name":"Tokenomy"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"APPC","market":{"identifier":"tokenomy","name":"Tokenomy"},"target":"TEN"}]},{"address":"0x1a8f615F0dD39B9DE8ad26db89Cfa76F7c9D0274","description":"","id":"utour","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a8f615f0dd39b9de8ad26db89cfa76f7c9d0274"],"facebook_username":"utour.dts","homepage":["https://www.utour.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"UTourDTS","twitter_screen_name":"UTourDTS"},"name":"UTour","symbol":"uto","tickers":[{"base":"UTO","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x1a95B271B0535D15fa49932Daba31BA612b52946","description":"There was no ICO for Minereum.

That is, each transaction only changes the state of one single account. Send transactions are separated from receive transactions, thereby obviating the need to wait for a transfer to be complete before the initiation of another transaction. The hierarchical design of the consensus algorithm allows horizontal scalability in consensus groups.\n\nAsynchronous Architecture\nVite splits transactions into transaction pairs according to a \"request-response\" pattern. The writing and verification of transactions are asynchronously decoupled, thereby supporting ultra-high throughput. Inter-contract communications are based on an asynchronous messaging model.\n\nReactive Contract\nMessage-Driven\nWith an event-driven architecture, every smart contract is viewed as an independent service. Contracts communicate via messages without sharing state.\n\nSolidity++\nSolidity++\u2019s syntax is compatible with most of that of Solidity. The new syntax supports asynchronous semantics, contract scheduling, and provides a series of standard libraries, such as string manipulation, floating-point operations, basic mathematical operations, containers, sorting, and so on.\n\nIntegrated Decentralized Ecosystem\nEnd-to-end system for value transfer\nVite itself is a decentralized exchange that supports digital asset issuance, cross-chain value transmission, and inter-token transactions based on the Loopring protocol. A quota-based resource allocation mechanism allows light users to pay zero fees and gas. Users can obtain computing resources in multiple ways. Vite also supports quota leasing.\n\ndApp Mini Programs\nThe Vite client features an engine for creating HTML5-based decentralized mini programs. This engine simplifies the process of dApp development and deployment.","id":"vite","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4438416,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x1b793e49237758dbd8b752afc9eb4b329d5da016","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1b793E49237758dBD8b752AFC9Eb4b329d5Da016","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1b793e49237758dbd8b752afc9eb4b329d5da016"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/CsVY76q"],"homepage":["https://www.vite.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/vitelabs/go-vite"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"vite_en"},"name":"Vite","symbol":"vite","tickers":[{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"BCH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"dextop","name":"DEx.top"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"VITE","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x1bF7Fd22709733cCD7c45AB27Dd02C7EC8E50078","description":"Quiztok is Blockchain based Quiz reward platform, where everyone can create and play the quiz.\n\nQTCON is the Reward token of Quiztok Service","id":"quiztok","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x1bf7fd22709733ccd7c45ab27dd02c7ec8e50078"],"facebook_username":"quiztok1","homepage":["http://www.quiztok.com/ko/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"QTCON"},"name":"Quiztok","symbol":"qtcon","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x1c4481750daa5Ff521A2a7490d9981eD46465Dbd","description":"Cornerstone Of The Decentralized Web","id":"blockmason-credit-protocol","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2129993,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x1c4481750daa5ff521a2a7490d9981ed46465dbd","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c4481750daa5ff521a2a7490d9981ed46465dbd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1c4481750daa5ff521a2a7490d9981ed46465dbd"],"homepage":["https://blockmason.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/blockmason/credit-protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/blockmason","twitter_screen_name":"blockmasonio"},"name":"BlockMason Credit Protocol","symbol":"bcpt","tickers":[{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"idcm","name":"IDCM"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"idcm","name":"IDCM"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCPT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x1c4b7d0e1885bd7667Af3378E0c538F74E712006","description":"The internet of games is the network of videogames, electronic media, software, consoles, internet devices and personal computers with gamers, software developers, and videogame publishers which enables these subjects to connect and exchange data.","id":"playgroundz","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/playgroundz-official-blog"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c4b7d0e1885bd7667af3378e0c538f74e712006","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1c4b7d0e1885bd7667af3378e0c538f74e712006"],"homepage":["http://www.playgroundz.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Playgroundz/smart-contracts"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"playgroundz","twitter_screen_name":"PlaygroundzIOG"},"name":"Playgroundz","symbol":"iog","tickers":[{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"hotbit","name":"Hotbit"},"target":"HTB"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"hotbit","name":"Hotbit"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOG","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x1c79ab32C66aCAa1e9E81952B8AAa581B43e54E7","description":"TokenStars is the talent management platform (sports & showbiz), that connects stars, fans and advertisers.\n\u2022 Platform is launched: 6 modules are live on blockchain.\n\u2022 10,000 registered users on the platform (additionally to the ICO participants) and 6,000 tokenholders.\n\nProject solves 4 major problems of the industry:\n1.

CNC token was acknowledged to be the utility token. CNC token is a utility token, which is used to pay commissions for loan contracts. The life cycle of the CNC token implies a gradual reduction of the overall number of tokens in circulation, which never goes down to zero. All tokens that have not been sold during the ICO are to be destroyed. All platform commissions are indicated in USD but are accepted only in the form of tokens All the tokens once accepted as a commission payment are blocked for a period of five years. These principles lead to the constant increase in the value of CNC, whereas token divisibility allows payments with its hundredth or thousandth parts. The team of more than 80 highly qualified experts creates a global network that lends fiat money to individuals and small businesses using crypto assets as a collateral. Thus, there is no necessity any more to sell crypto assets to get money. eCoinomic.net project got the operating licenses from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications of Estonia: -Operating license FVR000181: Providing services of exchanging a virtual currency against a fiat currency -Operating license FRK000150: Providing a virtual currency wallet service Highest score at ratings \u2028\u2028The best experts of TOP ICO Ratings evaluated eCoinomic.net ICO with highest rate!

However, at present, all the centralized social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Snapchat, etc., are facing many pain points.\n\nThe security of users' private information cant be guaranteed;\nThe user data can be used by the platform at any time;\nThere is a lack of incentive as the values created within the content of the user belong, at last, to the platform;\nCredit system vulnerability, false information, and low social efficiency.\n\nThe social network is a natural source applied to the centralized block chain technology. GSC's vision is to utilize the block chain technology to restructure the values of the next generation of social networking platforms and let the security of the private data and the digital assets become individual.

It\u2019s complementary to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable solution for the Ethereum network.\n\nThere are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in union with any ERC-20 token.\n\nThe Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany\u2019s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen. Also the founder of PediaPress, Hees has been a core developer of Ethereum since March 2014. Being a core developer for Ethereum, it is evident on how the founder sees the flaws in the current its present protocol with ways to improve it. Interestingly enough, the website does not include RDN as one of their main blockchain developments, which could be attributed to the difficulty of highlighting a wide variety of projects they are currently undertaking on one page. However, there are no updates on the status of the Raiden Network Project on either Twitter nor Medium since December 1st, 2017.\n\nRaiden can be used for a wide variety of applications and purposes such as Micropayments For Content Distribution, Decentralized M2M Markets, API Access and Fast Decentralized Exchanges.\"","id":"raiden-network","links":{"announcement_url":["https://www.medium.com/@raiden_network"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x255aa6df07540cb5d3d297f0d0d4d84cb52bc8e6","https://etherscan.io/token/0x255aa6df07540cb5d3d297f0d0d4d84cb52bc8e6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x255aa6df07540cb5d3d297f0d0d4d84cb52bc8e6"],"chat_url":["https://gitter.im/raiden-network/raiden","https://riot.im/app/#/room/#raiden-network:matrix.org"],"homepage":["https://raiden.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/raidennetwork","twitter_screen_name":"raiden_network"},"name":"Raiden Network Token","symbol":"rdn","tickers":[{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"bitkub","name":"Bitkub"},"target":"THB"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ninecoin","name":"9coin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"ninecoin","name":"9coin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"oax","name":"OAX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RDN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x2564C4dF85bbCCEf04B870d42f96bcc627B24957","description":"CTA's ecological application chain is the first global blockchain-based standardization platform that integrates culture, tourism and agriculture.

Simple Token is that solution.Simple Token enables all types of businesses to tokenize their assets. It empowers mainstream apps to have their own branded tokens, helping them set up their own crypto based economy on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network.\n\nThe Simple Token website lists over 35 people as part of its team, with other sections listing even more people as it advisors and extended team. Jason Goldberg is the CEO, with an 18 year career and experience in multiple countries and sectors. He is assisted by Sunil Khedar at the CTO position, and Ben Bollen as the Chief Blockchain Strategist. The team is well recognised by the investor community and markets in general. This is easy to see when you observe that it is backed by multiple VCs, including 500Startups, Greycroft, and China\u2019s Tencent among others.\n\nOST is the future of business tokenization, allowing companies to have their own branded tokens without the costs of setting up a blockchain infrastructure. Faster transaction times, since transactions are run on their own side chains rather than the Ethereum Main Net, avoiding the Ethereum network congestion.\n\nWith the team providing monthly updates, it\u2019s evident there is still a lot of work to be done. The ostKIT alpha is close to being released, and serves as the first public version of the complete blockchain toolkit for businesses. ostKYC is already live, and uses the OST token for all billing purposes. Other tools currently in development include a block explorer and an enterprise-grade email marketing solution. There\u2019s also the consumer-oriented wallet to keep an eye on, as well as an updated version of the Simple Token protocol itself.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/ost-token/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of OST.","id":"simple-token","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2266379,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x2c4e8f2d746113d0696ce89b35f0d8bf88e0aeca","https://etherscan.io/token/0x2c4e8f2d746113d0696ce89b35f0d8bf88e0aeca","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2c4e8f2d746113d0696ce89b35f0d8bf88e0aeca"],"facebook_username":"OST","homepage":["https://ost.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-contracts","https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/openst-platform"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OSTdotcom/","telegram_channel_identifier":"ostdotcom","twitter_screen_name":"OSTdotcom"},"name":"OST","symbol":"ost","tickers":[{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ST","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"gbx","name":"Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"ST","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"OST","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x2C72EE35637cb6df00f8C07595b564a05f667006","description":"ECP would contribute to the expansion of the cryptocurrency industry to the public, and would strengthen popularization through forming partnerships with diverse industries; shopping centers, hotels, eco and global businesses.

The gaming economy is estimated at $450 billion\n\nThere are two types of assets available on DMarket. The first type is a virtual Steam item. This Steam item is an in-game asset this is available for a specific game. At the moment there is a horde of items available for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. There is also a DMarket Blockchain item that is an internal blockchain item that can be traded on the DMarket blockchain.\n\nUsers can sell Steam items for US Dollars (USD) or DMarket items for USD or DMC, the internal DMarket cryptocurrency. Users can buy Steam items for USD or DMC or DMarket items for DMC. In order to sell Steam items on DMarket, users have to connect their Steam account to their DMarket account. DMarket blockchain items can be traded without connecting to Steam. Users have to register on DMarket. This creates a DMC wallet for them where they can store their DMC currency and DMarket items. The DMarket platform also has its own block explorer. All wallets and transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.\n\nDMarket has a future-proof use case as the demand for a universal gaming trading platform is imminent. Strategic partnerships between game title developers, the gaming community and gamers will ensure that DMarket lives well beyond its proprietary blockchain phase.","id":"dmarket","links":{"announcement_url":["https://dmarket.com/blog/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2041720,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x2ccbff3a042c68716ed2a2cb0c544a9f1d1935e1","https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ccbff3a042c68716ed2a2cb0c544a9f1d1935e1","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2ccbff3a042c68716ed2a2cb0c544a9f1d1935e1"],"facebook_username":"dmarketcommunity","homepage":["https://dmarket.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/suntechsoft/dmarket-smartcontract"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/D_Market/","telegram_channel_identifier":"dmarket_io","twitter_screen_name":"dmarket_com"},"name":"DMarket","symbol":"dmt","tickers":[{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"DMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0x2cfd4c10c075Fa51649744245EC1D0aA3d567e23","description":"Infinity Pay's platform will allow anyone to easily convert their blockchain assets into fiat via (ATM, Wire Transfer, ACH Withdrawals).

Energy payments are being made with MCW. Furthermore payment validation and verification is also being achieved by the system. All tests have been carried out and concluded. Full deployment is currently underway. The immediate community for MCW is the staff of the utility company; every staff is entitled to some MCW and the airdrop has been done. Free token airdrops to interested parties from the twitter community have also been done.\n\nReason for Project: A notable obstacle to economic growth of under developed countries is inadequate electric energy due primarily to very high losses within the existing Electricity Transmission and Distribution networks. The electricity infrastructure is often times weak and old with outdated installations. The most profound and fundamental cause of the high losses can be directly linked to revenue leakages which can be as high as 80% in some cases.

The more successful the project, the more people will know about it!\n\nIn the last two years, the world has experienced new epidemies due to refusal of vaccinations: unvaccinated people are infected with highly contagious infections like measles with a 100 percent chance. In 2018, according to WHO, more than 82,000 children and adults in Europe were infected with measles, the epidemy began in 2017: then the number of cases increased to 13,000 per year. Compare: in 2016, there were only 5,273 registered cases in Europe. There are many rumors around vaccination, fake information and false research. And the rare side effects that all drugs have are artificially exaggerated.\n\nAccording to WHO, messages about danger of vaccines in most cases are fake in nature. At the same time rare negative aspects of vaccination are widely publicized in mass media, while many positive aspects are often silenced and cause less interest in people.\n\nScientists who conducted inaccurate researches are to be blamed for hysteria against vaccinations as well. In 1998, the British magazine The Lancet published a study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, that vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella cause autism. The study was widely reported, and its findings were widely spoken of. However, the work was withdrawn after other scientists recognized Wakefield's findings unsubstantiated. Later the doctor was deprived of his license.\n\nRefusal of vaccinations is also associated with belief in conspiracy theory, primarily in the conspiracy of pharmaceutical companies to make a profit. However, the mass vaccination campaign is almost 10 times cheaper than the treatment of all patients if it is not carried out.\n\nAnti-vaccinators are also benefit to adherents of unproven alternative medicine. After all, in addition to drugs for the treatment of diseases, refusal of vaccination allows you to sell a lot of other drugs, for example, dietary supplements for improving immunity and antivirals. That's just unlike vaccines such supplements have no proven effectiveness, no one checks them, and some of them are just homoeopathy, which is equal to the placebo effect and is not recommended for patients in developed countries for a long time, for example, in the UK and the United States.\n\nThe world health organization website lists vaccines for thirty-five diseases. Some of them are difficult and dangerous with complications, others simply do not have treatment. In the long term, vaccinated people create strong collective immunity. If around one unvaccinated and ill person there are ten vaccinated, the epidemic simply can not break out. For such a barrier against the disease, 95% of the population must be vaccinated.\n\nThere are people who can\u2019t be vaccinated because of contraindications (infants, people with immunodeficiency or other severe chronic conditions), therefore, it is necessary to achieve 100% vaccination, among those who can be vaccinated in principle.\n\nStatistics is affected by anti-vaccinators who, knowingly or because of fear, do not vaccinate themselves and their children. German doctors wrote an article in which they identified several types of anti-vaccinators. They are classified for reasons of refusal:\n\"Careless\" do not take the threat seriously and do not think about diseases.\n\"Lazy\" just don't want to mess with it.\n\"Careful\" are always at a crossroads and will weigh all the\" pros \"and\" cons\" to the last.\n\"Suspicious\" fanatical against vaccinations and don't believe even the most common arguments from doctors.","id":"healthylife","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5123078,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x349c14bca4e70d5ea4a4c08e7cffce51708b4887"],"homepage":["http://heliweb.info/"],"twitter_screen_name":"Healthy_vaccin"},"name":"HealthyLife","symbol":"heli","tickers":[{"base":"HELI","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HELI","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x34Dd5EDfED51c632d1d4d2502bC901EfB5fdfCD4","description":"Juriseum is a platform for rethinking the way we interact with legal documents & data.\n\nWhile existing systems for legal documents are inefficient, not transparent, and are not secure, our team is building a secure, useful, & easy-to-use platform based on blockchain technology.

Theta is an open source protocol purpose-built to power the decentralized streaming network and will allow for vertical decentralized apps (DApps) to be built on top of the platform to enable esports, music, TV/movies, education, enterprise conferencing, peer-to-peer streaming, and more. SLIVER.tv\u2019s DApp will be the first application built on the Theta network leveraging its existing user base of millions of esports viewers.\n\nDSN and the Theta protocol solve various challenges the video streaming industry faces today. First, Theta tokens are used as an incentive to encourage individual users to share their redundant memory and bandwidth resources as caching nodes for video streams. This improves the quality of stream delivery and solves the \u201clast-mile\u201d delivery problem, the main bottleneck for traditional stream delivery pipelines, especially for high resolution high bitrate 360\u00b0 virtual reality (VR) streams. Second, with sufficient amount of caching nodes, the majority of viewers will pull streams from peering caching nodes. This significantly reduces content delivery network (CDN) bandwidth costs, which is a major concern for video streaming sites.\n\nLastly, the Theta network greatly improves the streaming market efficiency by streamlining the video delivery process. For example, advertisers can target end viewers at a lower cost and reward influencers more transparently.The Theta blockchain introduces three novel concepts: Reputation Dependent Mining: In the Theta protocol, the caching nodes play the role of miners in the blockchain. The block reward is not a constant, but depends on the reputation score of the caching node that mined the block. To obtain more mining rewards, miners not only spend computation power to mine blocks, but also relay video streams to downstream viewers to increase their reputation scores.\n\nGlobal Reputation Consensus: We propose a mechanism for the Theta network to reach the global consensus on the reputation scores for each caching node. Proof-of-Engagement: We introduce a novel Proof-of-Engagement scheme to prove that viewers legitimately consume the video streams, providing better transparency to advertisers and a basis for viewers to earn Theta tokens for engaging with the content.","id":"theta-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@ThetaLabs"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2451089,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x3883f5e181fccaf8410fa61e12b59bad963fb645","https://etherscan.io/token/0x3883f5e181fccaF8410FA61e12b59BAd963fb645","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3883f5e181fccaf8410fa61e12b59bad963fb645"],"facebook_username":"ThetaToken","homepage":["https://www.thetatoken.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-infrastructure-ledger-explorer","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-infrastructure-vault","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-protocol-delivery-lib","https://github.com/thetatoken/theta-protocol-ledger"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/thetatoken","twitter_screen_name":"thetatoken"},"name":"Theta Network","symbol":"theta","tickers":[{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"biki","name":"Biki"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"chainex","name":"ChainEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"coinplace","name":"Coinplace"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"financex","name":"FinanceX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"financex","name":"FinanceX"},"target":"IDR"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"financex","name":"FinanceX"},"target":"VND"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"tokok","name":"TOKOK"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THETA","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0x388Fd8A5145D6EF85aAE14D494F93Df9D1c7c00C","description":"The Bitcoin-regular is a modern solution for Ecommerce for the upcoming crypto phase and it wil be beneficial for the relative users.","id":"bitcoinregular","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x388fd8a5145d6ef85aae14d494f93df9d1c7c00c"],"facebook_username":"bitcoinregular","homepage":["https://bitcoinregular.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"BITCOINREGULAR","twitter_screen_name":"bitcoin_regular"},"name":"BitcoinRegular","symbol":"btrl","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x3893b9422Cd5D70a81eDeFfe3d5A1c6A978310BB","description":"Mithril is a decentralized ecosystem on the ethereum blockchain. It is a system that rewards users who engage in \u201csocial mining\u201d. Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\n\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\n\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale=en\">MyCrypto</a>, or Coinfy.\n\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space. If Mithril gets its way, centralized social networking companies may soon have worthy competitors that offer users more control of their data while rewarding people for creating the content that is ultimately the life-blood of all social networks.","id":"mithril","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/mithriltoken"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3108554,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x3893b9422cd5d70a81edeffe3d5a1c6a978310bb","https://etherscan.io/token/0x3893b9422cd5d70a81edeffe3d5a1c6a978310bb","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3893b9422cd5d70a81edeffe3d5a1c6a978310bb"],"facebook_username":"MithrilToken","homepage":["https://mith.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/mithio/mithril-smart-contract"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MithrilToken/","telegram_channel_identifier":"MithrilChat","twitter_screen_name":"MithrilToken"},"name":"Mithril","symbol":"mith","tickers":[{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"LTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"bitopro","name":"BitoPro"},"target":"TWD"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"bitrabbit","name":"BitRabbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MIT","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MIT","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MIT","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"instantbitex","name":"Instant Bitex"},"target":"BCH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"instantbitex","name":"Instant Bitex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"instantbitex","name":"Instant Bitex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"instantbitex","name":"Instant Bitex"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"lbank","name":"Lbank"},"target":"QTUM"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"max_maicoin","name":"Max Maicoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"max_maicoin","name":"Max Maicoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"max_maicoin","name":"Max Maicoin"},"target":"MAX"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"max_maicoin","name":"Max Maicoin"},"target":"TWDT"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"max_maicoin","name":"Max Maicoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MITH","market":{"identifier":"tradeio","name":"Trade.io"},"target":"TIOX"}]},{"address":"0x38968746147BBAeb882F356Ad9A57594bB158235","description":"With our impression-based model, the 20-60% commission is a thing of the past.

Rather than just looking at the software side of things, the project also tackles the hardware aspect. To realize the optimal performance of blockchain applications, things will need to change in the near future. As such, this team is building an architecture which uses thousands of CPU and FPGA resources to create a more versatile and scalable ecosystem.\n\nThere are a few aspects of the High-Performance Blockchain project to take into account. First of all, there is the chip-level acceleration engine which provides accelerated hardware chips to power this entire ecosystem. Secondly, the software side of the High-Performance Blockchain is integrated with the new dedicated hardware accelerated engine and focuses on depth and scaling customization. Third, the project claims it can produce a throughput in the millions of transactions without any major problems.\n\nWhile all of this sounds amazing, it is difficult to come by any real information regarding the technical aspects of either the hardware or the software side of High-Performance Blockchain. While the team mainly focuses on blockchain integration for real-world business cases, it remains to be seen how their chips will operate and how their algorithms are created. It seems the High-Performance Blockchain project is closely connected to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">NEO</a> infrastructure, which could introduce some interesting developments down the line.\n\nBuilding the High-Performance Blockchain infrastructure will take a lot of time and money.

A testnet version of this project will be launched at some point in 2018, which will undergo further improvements for several months.

Targeting the $47B online gambling market, FunFair isn\u2019t actually a casino. Instead, the underlying gaming technology is licensed out to casinos and other gambling platforms. The FunFair team is attempting to solve some of the biggest problems online casinos face: slow performance, high operating costs, and lack of user trust. Through the use of blockchain technology and Fate Channels, an in-house built version of state channels, the products they license have the potential fix all of them.\n\nFUN is an ERC-20 token that you use in every part of the FunFair platform. It\u2019s the only token accepted for in-game credits, how game creators in the marketplace are paid, what casinos must pay their licensing with and receive revenues in, and all fees on the platform must be paid in FUN. A total of 11,000,000,000 FUN tokens were created on June 22, 2017, and no more will be created. With a fixed supply, the token is deflationary and should experience sharp increases in price over time as demand for it increases. Furthermore, the FUN that\u2019s paid as fees will be burned for the first two years which should further drive price upwards. Casinos can also stake the FUN tokens in their bankrolls to receive additional dividends.\n\nThe 30+ person FunFair team is based out of London and is led by Jez San, OBE. San\u2019s entire career has revolved around entrepreneurship and the computer gaming industry. He founded Argonaut Software as a teen and created the first chip to power 3D games like Star Fox and Harry Potter. Rounding out his resume, San also founded the 3D online poker room, PKR, and is an investor in one of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken. Other members of the team are just as impressive. Jeremy Longley, founder and CTO, co-founded PKR with San and has over 15 years of experience managing development teams. FunFair COO, David Greyling, was previously the International Director of William Hill \u2013 a worldwide betting and gaming company.\n\nFunFair is attempting to enter the gigantic online gaming market by providing a solution that\u2019s unique to the blockchain industry. Instead of acting as a casino, the company is licensing out their technology to other casinos which helps to mitigate their liability and risk. The project already has a working product and plans to launch early this year. With the wealth of experience that the team has in the gaming space, it\u2019s hard to see this project failing. If FunFair can overcome the market domination of current incumbents using traditional technology, blockchain-based casino games could be the new industry paradigm.","id":"funfair","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1968383,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x419d0d8bdd9af5e606ae2232ed285aff190e711b","https://etherscan.io/token/0x419d0d8bdd9af5e606ae2232ed285aff190e711b","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x419d0d8bdd9af5e606ae2232ed285aff190e711b"],"homepage":["https://funfair.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/FunfairTech","twitter_screen_name":"FunFairTech"},"name":"FunFair","symbol":"fun","tickers":[{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"c2cx","name":"C2CX"},"target":"LONG"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"c2cx","name":"C2CX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"LMX"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"TUSD"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"vebitcoin","name":"Vebitcoin"},"target":"TRY"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FUN","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0x419c4dB4B9e25d6Db2AD9691ccb832C8D9fDA05E","description":"Dragonchain is one of the newly launched cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts following its relaunch. The coin seems to be leading on the technology front irrespective of its market capitalisation trends, which is why it's also being anticipated to be <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum\u2019s</a> competitor. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, where sensitive business logic and smart contract functionality is held by the owner. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol DGRN & has a total supply of 433,494,437 coins. Dragonchain uses serverless smart contracts from its pre-built library. This feature is unique to this cryptocurrency, as it can create smart contracts, with or without cryptocurrencies.\n\nDragonchain was developed by Joe Roets who is its CEO and Chief Architect with a team of 4 core developers. The team is backed by a strong advisory board with Jeff Garzik on board who is established icon in the Bitcoin network. It was developed after exploration of 20 use cases and applications. It was released under the Apache 2 license in October 2016 to integrate real business applications onto a blockchain, protect business data and operations, currency agnosticism and multi-currency support. The launch of Dragonchain Foundation, a non profit corporation, in January\u201917 maintains the ownership and responsibility of Dragonchain\u2019s open source code.\n\nEnterprises can easily design smart contracts in a variety of languages like Python, Node, C# & Java. The contracts can be specific to their business needs to include both private internal and public blockchain interactions. The Currency Smart Contracts help organizations to retrieve and transfer specified currency amounts between wallet addresses and check balances which can be run on schemas like ERC20, ERC223, etc. Dragonchain helps enterprises to leverage their models using blockchain by allowing development and integration before the economic model is known. Monetization can be applied after sufficient real data is available & system is functioning.\n\nDragonChain\u2019s platform is establishing a niche in the crypto world with its layered security feature. The 5-layer security model adds great credibility to their overall goal of facilitating business integration into the blockchain. Additionally, DragonChain is seen as a strong rival to Ethereum because of the platform\u2019s ability to scale; an issue that Ethereum has been notorious for. As of January 2018, the DragonChain team is raising funds and finishing development of the platform. Although the exact date is currently unannounced, the DRGN platform is expected to fully launch sometime this year.","id":"dragonchain","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2096284,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e","https://etherscan.io/token/0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e"],"facebook_username":"dragonchaingang","homepage":["https://dragonchain.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/dragonchain/dragonchain"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dragonchainblockchain","telegram_channel_identifier":"dragontalk","twitter_screen_name":"dragonchaingang"},"name":"Dragonchain","symbol":"drgn","tickers":[{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"chainex","name":"ChainEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DRN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"KCS"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"thetokenstore","name":"Token.Store"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DRGN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0x41AB1b6fcbB2fA9DCEd81aCbdeC13Ea6315F2Bf2","description":"XinFin (www.XinFin.org) is a Hybrid Blockchain technology company focused on international trade and finance.

The XDCE token will largely be for traders to compete against other ERC20 tokens across exchange boards making XinFin's reach more versatile in the open Crypto Market and can be swapped with the standard XDC token. The XDCE token will be available and will be tradeable on most exchanges. This means traders will reap the benefit of high volume and quick trades through multiple exchanges. Traders, by using the XDCE token, will allow for the XDC01 (XDC) token to be used primarily for institutional level partners.

The different organizations such as doctors, hospitals, laboratories, pharmacists and health insurers can request permission to access a patient\u2019s record to serve their purpose and record transactions on the distributed ledger. Medicalchain provides solutions to today\u2019s health record problems. The platform is built to securely store and share electronic health records. By digitizing health records and empowering users we can leverage countless industry synergies.\n\nMedicalchain is building a platform for secure storage and utilization of electronic health records on the blockchain. The company is also building a telemedicine platform to allow users to directly connect with healthcare professionals, share their records and get consultations, second opinions, online through a secure channel.The company was originally founded in February 2016 to provide a software solution inside hospitals. The solution is known as \u2018Discharge Summary\u2019 and it uses a workflow tool to accurately write an assessment of a patient as they are being discharged from surgery or a long hospital visit. The software is currently being used by hospitals in UK and the team decided to extend this project and go further with Medicalchain.\n\nMedicalchain wants people to have access to their health records everywhere. Today, you can travel far and wide and you will have access to your phone, contacts, photos, files, bank accounts but not your health records - probably the most important and life saving information you need. In most developed countries around the world you, as a patient, have a legal right to request your records. Medicalchain is providing you with a platform to do that. But more importantly, Medicalchain wants its users to be able to use it immediately by communicating and sharing (on a time limited basis) with other doctors. The bigger vision is to allow pharmaceutical, insurance and other healthcare organisations and stakeholders to be able to interact with health records on patients' terms. Medicalchain believes that health records should be a part of everyone\u2019s life and not just referred to when someone is ill.","id":"medicalchain","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medicalchain.com/en/news/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2113942,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x41dbecc1cdc5517c6f76f6a6e836adbee2754de3","https://etherscan.io/token/0x41dbecc1cdc5517c6f76f6a6e836adbee2754de3","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x41dbecc1cdc5517c6f76f6a6e836adbee2754de3"],"facebook_username":"medicalchain","homepage":["https://medicalchain.com/en/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/medicalchain/medicalchain-api-docs"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalchain/","telegram_channel_identifier":"medicalchain","twitter_screen_name":"medical_chain"},"name":"Medicalchain","symbol":"mtn","tickers":[{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MTN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x41e5560054824eA6B0732E656E3Ad64E20e94E45","description":"Using blockchain technology in an unprecedented way, Civic is more than just a coin or a cryptocurrency to trade.

In AiLink Ecology, the user's behavior data will be recorded on the node of blockchain, which can not be tampered with, and the transaction behaviors of participants in all social networks are realized and constrained by smart contract technology. Under the premise of ensuring the privacy of users, anyone can depict the user's digital portraits through the data on the blockchain, and determine whether the person is credible by the blockchain score, thereby greatly reduce the trust cost between people and build a highly trusted ecosystem.\n\nOn the basis of trust, AiLink will directly break through six degrees of separation. Users can directly connect to or conclude transactions with any node on the network at a low cost, so that information and value can be effectively spread throughout the blockchain network. Then, publishers will achieve their goals, communicators will get token rewards, benefiting all nodes spread throughout the network.\n\nIn addition, AiLink capture and process massive users open data on blockchain networks with AI operations, design unique formulas, match users with high affinity, to achieve the desired results, such as in the same crowd of music lovers, the probability of the person matching the music preferences matches is higher depending on the user's preference for the genre of music. The frequency of interaction between users will also be used to calculate friends degree, so as to continuously improve the relationship between friends.\n\nAt the same time, AiLink will provide more user-friendly applications, AiLink will start with social games, let users get the concept and value of blockchain more simply and directly, then improve the entire social ecosystem gradually.","id":"ailink-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4289c043a12392f1027307fb58272d8ebd853912","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4289c043a12392f1027307fb58272d8ebd853912","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4289c043a12392f1027307fb58272d8ebd853912"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/ailinkofficial2"],"facebook_username":"ailinkofficial","homepage":["http://ailink.in/pc.html"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ailinkofficial/ailink"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"ailinkofficial","twitter_screen_name":"ailinkofficial"},"name":"AiLink Token","symbol":"ali","tickers":[{"base":"ALI","market":{"identifier":"bilaxy","name":"Bilaxy"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ALI","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ALI","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ALI","market":{"identifier":"lbank","name":"Lbank"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x4290563C2D7c255B5EEC87f2D3bD10389f991d68","description":"UIP (short for UnlimitedIP ) is a recreational copyright intelligent trading platform created by Link Entertainments Technology based on EOS.

We\u2019ll use Ethereum smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected in a manner that is adaptable to the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a native Web API layer.\n\nLink solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still primarily functions as a vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial applications.\n\nAt Blockmason, we are true blockchain believers \u2014 it is only a matter of time until blockchain spurs the healthcare revolution, empowers economic freedom in developing countries, and stabilizes our fragile mass payment systems. However, it is impossible to realize this beautiful crypto-future until the completion of essential components of blockchain infrastructure.\n\nBlockchain has a high barrier to entry. From a development perspective, it requires learning Solidity, cryptography APIs, and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. From a user perspective, the hesitation is even simpler: decentralized applications are too damn tough to use! In a world that increasingly values convenience, it\u2019s difficult to convince people to increase their DApp usage when usage necessitates so many prerequisites, including creating and learning to use an Ethereum wallet, MetaMask, safely storing your private keys, and so on. Just try explaining to someone the long-term benefits of decentralized contracts when even those in charge of regulating new technologies have no idea how they work. All the public thinks is: why use a \u201csmart contract,\u201d when dumb contracts work just fine? Why use Lndr, when I could use Venmo?\n\nWhich brings us to one of Blockmason\u2019s core beliefs: for an emerging technology to succeed, it must value the user. For too long, the blockchain community has ignored functionality, in favor of niche technical development, finance, or profit \u2014 hindering mass adoption. This is not to say we don\u2019t love nerdy, precise technical advancement (we do!), but rather that we believe a smooth, exciting user experience is a necessary part of technological growth.\n\nFully realizing the potential of blockchain technology requires the mass adoption of blockchain technology. Mass adoption requires an enhanced user experience, which itself requires technological innovation. Conversely, any technical breakthrough, regardless of its importance, is squandered if it does not solve the user experience. Greater access to technology leads to greater technological advancement. Just think of us as blockchain\u2019s \u201cTyphoid Mary.\u201d\n\nBlockmason Link \u2014 the missing block in blockchain\u2019s ever growing tower. An innovation that sparks innovation.","id":"blockmason-link","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@blockmason"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x42bedd647e387dabec65a7dc3a3babcc68bb664d"],"facebook_username":"blockmasonio","homepage":["https://blockmason.link/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/blockmason/link-token"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/blockmason/","telegram_channel_identifier":"blockmasonlink","twitter_screen_name":"blockmasonio"},"name":"BlockMason Link","symbol":"blink","tickers":[{"base":"BLINK","market":{"identifier":"bw","name":"BW.com"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BLINK","market":{"identifier":"bw","name":"BW.com"},"target":"BWB"},{"base":"BLINK","market":{"identifier":"bw","name":"BW.com"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x42F1d3380cc1526eB182343dc3Bdd970CE664322","description":"In essence, Data Shield is a security technology that integrates \u201cdecentralization\u201d, \u201ccrushed distributed storage\u201d, \u201ccryptography\u201d and \u201cblockchain\u201d.

Their primary target market is inexperienced investors who are looking for an easy way to enter into the cryptocurrency markets, but they also have something to offer the more experienced investor, cryptocurrency and otherwise. And they claim to be able to set-up investment planning for anyone, regardless of their risk tolerance or background. Of course the main selling point of Dropil is the automation of the cryptocurrency trading process. The platform requires little input from investors and claims it will deliver high profit margins and minimal risk of losses.\n\nA second part of the Dropil platform is the Arthur bot. This bot is the risk management bot, which manages investor portfolios and also provides arbitrage analysis. While it is less complex than Dex, it is still important as it will monitor up to 13 different exchanges and 10 different coins to find arbitrage opportunities for you. What is most important to note is that this can all be done without the use of an API as well as no user accounts needed. Future plans include expanding this functionality.\n\nThe final aspect of the Dropil ecosystem is the DROP token, which is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">ERC-20</a> token that was created to help ensure privacy, while also powering the internal economy of Dropil. The team chose to use the ERC20 protocol to help foster compatibility and quick exchange executions to benefit the entire community. The DROP token has a total supply of 30 billion coins, which was determined to be an optimal amount for asset management by the developers. It was also chosen with the optimal user base in mind, as well as the need for coins to be traded and achieve widespread adoption. The need to use the DROP token to access the feature of Dropil should ensure a good implementation and demand for the token.\n\nDropil looks like an interesting project that is tackling the complexity of investing in cryptocurrencies. The idea of automated trading, investing and arbitrage is a compelling one, but it does sound familiar. Stocks, commodities and forex all have these types of automated systems, or robots, that promise guaranteed returns. I have yet to come across one that is reliable in the long term. Perhaps the artificial intelligence algorithm is advanced enough to change that. Perhaps cryptocurrency market movements are easier to analyze and predict.","id":"dropil","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2795128,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4672bad527107471cb5067a887f4656d585a8a31","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4672bad527107471cb5067a887f4656d585a8a31","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4672bad527107471cb5067a887f4656d585a8a31"],"facebook_username":"DropilCoin","homepage":["https://dropil.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Dropil/Token"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dropil/","telegram_channel_identifier":"dropil","twitter_screen_name":"dropilcoin"},"name":"Dropil","symbol":"drop","tickers":[{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DROP","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4689a4e169eB39cC9078C0940e21ff1Aa8A39B9C","description":"Proton is a public chain that is dedicated to data fusion and collaboration.

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM\u2019s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\n\nFOAM Token Functionality\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\n\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\n\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes\u2019 clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph, this \u2018Dynamic Proof of Location\u2019 is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace\u2019s control.","id":"foam-protocol","links":{"announcement_url":["https://t.me/Foamprotocol"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121"],"chat_url":["https://gitter.im/f-o-a-m/"],"facebook_username":"foamprotocol","homepage":["https://www.foam.space/"],"official_forum_url":["http://discourse.foam.space"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/f-o-a-m/","https://github.com/f-o-a-m/foam.css","https://github.com/f-o-a-m/plasma-demo"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/foamprotocol/","telegram_channel_identifier":"foamspace","twitter_screen_name":"foamspace"},"name":"FOAM","symbol":"foam","tickers":[{"base":"FOA","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FOA","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"FOAM","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"FOAM","market":{"identifier":"poloniex","name":"Poloniex"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"FOAM","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar

We have multiple development projects already running, such as Cocobay Danang and Marine City in Vietnam, and we are offering the world's first real estate pre-IPO blockchain offering before the fund lists on the New York Stock Exchange. For transparency, all of our contracts are posted on our website.\n\nRelex is a blockchain based funding vehicle creation of the parent company Squawk Advisors Inc. Squawk Advisors has an FDI development portfolio across multiple countries in the world. The Squawk group of companies has been contracting with FDI projects since 2014, and this Fall 2017, we are bringing our offerings onto the blockchain, such as Cocobay Danang, with its iconic tower seen here.\n\nRelex is the world's first cryptocurrency based real estate developer opportunity. RLX holders have the opportunity to invest in projects during the development phase, which results in exciting opportunities such as proxy ownership of resorts, shopping malls, offices, and more. And gain more rights as a proxy developer, having your voice heard regarding design and implementation of the final master plan.\n\nThere is now a better way to access yield, while retaining your standards for high transparency and high accountability for your investable capital. Introducing Relex, the world's first real estate development focused cryptocurrency, designed to provide better and simplified access for investors to high-yield projects around the world, while qualifying real estate projects to a higher level of transparency in order to be eligible for institutional capital consideration. We support projects in both developed and developing markets that strive to set the bar higher in the interest of project integrity.\n\nAccording to Jones Lang Lasalle's Global Real Estate Transparency Index 2016, almost 75% of global capital invested in commercial real estate is in the Top 10 most transparent countries in the world. That means that projects in countries with low transparency scores are considered ineligible projects for investment. What if transparency scores in projects located in developing countries were improved, upgrading these projects and making them eligible for a wider stream of capital consideration? Relex is solving this problem by increasing transparency and accountability standards for real estate development projects in developing nations with low transparency scores, and aligns itself with projects that are committed to transparency, integrity, and accountability in their real estate projects. With Relex, the projects that we partner with agree to fund their development projects on the Relex blockchain, and agree to a more strict line of transparency and accountability standards.\n\nIn turn, projects on the Relex blockchain get an increased transparency and accountability score, and become eligible for a wider stream of investable capital into their projects. This is a win-win situation for both the investor and the project owners, in which there is better capital access, and better access to real estate development projects with a high degree of yield.","id":"relex","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2075473,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4a42d2c580f83dce404acad18dab26db11a1750e","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4a42d2c580f83dce404acad18dab26db11a1750e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4a42d2c580f83dce404acad18dab26db11a1750e"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/relex_rus"],"facebook_username":"RelexTalk","homepage":["https://relex.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RelexRLX/","telegram_channel_identifier":"relex_core","twitter_screen_name":"RelexTalk"},"name":"Relex","symbol":"rlx","tickers":[{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"sistemkoin","name":"Sistemkoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"sistemkoin","name":"Sistemkoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"sistemkoin","name":"Sistemkoin"},"target":"TRY"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLX","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4A8F44BE523580a11cdB20e2C7C470Adf44Ec9BB","description":"We set up the Bit Miner Chain (BTMC) project based on the Blockchaintechnology so as to build a decentralized integrated serviceplatform for the transaction of AI chips.

SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users. Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes that are paper based.\n\nOne of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey.\n\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose \u201cskill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.\u201d Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers. Terry Lin is the product manager for this venture. In the past, Terry has been associated with many established projects including, AMZ Tracker, UBS and Build My Online Store. Lastly, Ari Propis is the accounting backbone of SelfKey. He has been in the crypto domain for more than five years and has previously worked as a consultant for various blockchain and international accounting startups. It was introduced into the market earlier this year, KEY tokens were initially traded at a modest price of US$0.08 per token.","id":"selfkey","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2310691,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4cc19356f2d37338b9802aa8e8fc58b0373296e7","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4cc19356f2d37338b9802aa8e8fc58b0373296e7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4cc19356f2d37338b9802aa8e8fc58b0373296e7"],"facebook_username":"SelfKeyNetwork","homepage":["https://selfkey.org"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/SelfKeyFoundation/Identity-Wallet"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfkey","telegram_channel_identifier":"selfkeyfoundation","twitter_screen_name":"SelfKey"},"name":"SelfKey","symbol":"key","tickers":[{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"SELFKEY","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"koinok","name":"Koinok"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"179DE71E-4637-4241-B944-C6DD0F0CD88B","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"179DE71E-4637-4241-B944-C6DD0F0CD88B","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"Probit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KEY","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4CEdA7906a5Ed2179785Cd3A40A69ee8bc99C466","description":"Aion is a revolutionary multi-tier blockchain platform that has been created to solve the pressing issue of limited operability between existing blockchains while still remaining capable of handling its own applications. It supports custom blockchain architectures, and it provides cross-chain interoperability. The Aion project comes at a very appropriate period, in a time where there\u2019s an ever-growing number of blockchains.Thus, interoperability is more important now that it ever has been. Interoperability will expand the horizons of multiple other blockchain platforms, not to mention those of enterprise-oriented companies.\n\nThe project is led by Matthew Spoke, the CEO of Nuco and board member on the EEA. Other big names include Jin Tu, Nuco\u2019s CTO, who has more than 15 years of experience in enterprise engineering and more than four years in the blockchain industry, and Peter Vessenes who has co-founded the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nThe token is the blockchain\u2019s power-source. It\u2019s used for securing the network, for creating new blockchains, as well as for monetizing inter-chain bridges. AION token is actually an ERC-20 token. In fact, the token is first offered as an ERC-20 token on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum blockchain</a>, and only then it can be changed to the official AION network token. When that happens, the token can freely stream between two blockchains. The best thing about this is that investors are not required to change their Aion Ethereum token (ERC-20) for the Aion-1 token, as they will always be interchangeable.\n\nIn order to buy AION, you will need to first purchase another cryptocurrency, preferably <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>. Fortunately, AION is supported by some very popular crypto exchanges out there such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitforex\">BitForex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/ethfinex\">Ethfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/liqui\">Liqui</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bancor\">Bancor Network</a>. There's a good chance that Aion, with its unique approach of solving interoperability issues, will become somewhat of a necessity for the cryptosphere in the following period.","id":"aion","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2215642,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4ceda7906a5ed2179785cd3a40a69ee8bc99c466","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4CEdA7906a5Ed2179785Cd3A40A69ee8bc99C466","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4ceda7906a5ed2179785cd3a40a69ee8bc99c466","https://mainnet.aion.network"],"facebook_username":"AionBlockchain","homepage":["https://aion.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/aionnetwork/AVM","https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion","https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_fastvm"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AionNetwork","telegram_channel_identifier":"aion_blockchain","twitter_screen_name":"Aion_Network"},"name":"Aion","symbol":"aion","tickers":[{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"bancor","name":"Bancor Network"},"target":"BNT"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"bcex","name":"BCEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"bitbox","name":"BITBOX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"bitbox","name":"BITBOX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AIO","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"chainex","name":"ChainEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"coinplace","name":"Coinplace"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"A1800D28-1DE4-41D9-8AF6-95BDAEFA523D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"A1800D28-1DE4-41D9-8AF6-95BDAEFA523D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"thetokenstore","name":"Token.Store"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AION","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4CF488387F035FF08c371515562CBa712f9015d4","description":"WePower enables renewable energy producers to raise capital by issuing their own energy tokens.

The traders can use the borrowed funds to margin trade, make a profit, and repay the lenders.","id":"lendroid-support-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x4de2573e27e648607b50e1cfff921a33e4a34405"],"homepage":["https://www.lendroid.com/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.lendroid.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/lendroidproject/tge-contracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lendroidproject/","telegram_channel_identifier":"lendroidproject","twitter_screen_name":"lendroidproject"},"name":"Lendroid Support Token","symbol":"lst","tickers":[{"base":"LST","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LST","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4f27053F32edA8Af84956437Bc00e5fFa7003287","description":"Thrive pay you for your data lowest ad fees ever fastest payments in the ad industry.","id":"thrive","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@thriveico"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2401702,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4f27053f32eda8af84956437bc00e5ffa7003287","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4f27053f32eda8af84956437bc00e5ffa7003287","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4f27053f32eda8af84956437bc00e5ffa7003287"],"facebook_username":"thrivelabs.io","homepage":["https://ico.thrivelabs.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/thrivelabs/contract"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ThriveLabs/","telegram_channel_identifier":"thriveico","twitter_screen_name":"WeareThrivelabs"},"name":"Thrive","symbol":"thrt","tickers":[{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"bitforex","name":"Bitforex"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"coinsuper","name":"Coinsuper"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"THRT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x4f3AfEC4E5a3F2A6a1A411DEF7D7dFe50eE057bF","description":"DIGIX DAO TOKENS.

According to the team behind the Hong Kong-based project, the network is also capable of handling 1000+ transactions per second. The platform\u2019s main goal is to offer users a stable and secure gambling environment.\n\nWaykiChain uses a DPoS consensus mechanism with eleven accounting nodes. The annual rate of return is 5% for the first year, with a 1% increase with every year that goes by. Each time a block is created, an accounting node is randomly associated. The accounting node gains all of the transaction fees in its accounting block. Users can earn interest by locking WaykiChain coins. The interest is automatically determined each time the votes for the corresponding user account change. The terms of betting are triggered by the initiator through smart contract transactions. Users can initiate various betting contract transactions, all of which can be searched and identified in the block browsers.\n\nEven though it\u2019s not a very popular project in the crypto space at the current moment, WaykiChain has the potential to expand its reach and spark the interest of people due to its decentralized gambling platform. The timing is also a very fortunate one, as the team seems to have everything in place before the start of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The project has a powerful dApp associated with its name. The WaykiChain Betting provides its users with real-time betting possibilities, in a transparent and open way. All the betting data is public, searchable, well organized, and cannot be changed or affected by any third-party interests. Any potential illegal actions can be, therefore, easily discovered.","id":"waykichain","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2667633,"blockchain_site":["http://47.106.77.165:8080/","https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4f878c0852722b0976a955d68b376e4cd4ae99e5","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4f878c0852722b0976a955d68b376e4cd4ae99e5","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4f878c0852722b0976a955d68b376e4cd4ae99e5"],"facebook_username":"waykichainofficial","homepage":["https://www.waykichain.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/WaykiChain/WaykiChain"]},"twitter_screen_name":"wayki_chain"},"name":"WaykiChain","symbol":"wicc","tickers":[{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WIC","market":{"identifier":"bcex","name":"BCEX"},"target":"CKUSD"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"hb_top","name":"Hb.top"},"target":"USDE"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"lbank","name":"Lbank"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"ninecoin","name":"9coin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"ninecoin","name":"9coin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"qbtc","name":"QBTC"},"target":"CNYT"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"qbtc","name":"QBTC"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WICC","market":{"identifier":"rfinex","name":"Rfinex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x5003B168b457B663c3c18FFcF5B6a24bEe8f59C7","description":"MUSK is a media alliance chain.

When <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> went live in 2015, it revolutionized what blockchain could bring to enterprise solution and traditional business. Blockchain was no longer just a medium for new age financial transaction, confined to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin\u2019s</a> potential to disrupt traditional currency exchange. With Ethereum powered smart contracts, Vitalik Buterin opened up a Pandora\u2019s Box of use cases for blockchain technology. Problem is, per their design, smart contracts can only manage data on the blockchain. Their potential, the ability to provide tamperproof, decentralized applications for uses the world over, is still largely untapped, as many of the smart contract programs built on Ethereum lack a bridge to the real world industries they\u2019re trying to improve.\n\nChainLink\u2019s first component consists of on-chain contracts deployed on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.  These oracle contracts process the data requests of users looking to take advantage of the network\u2019s oracle services. If a user or entity wants access to off-chain data, they submit a user contract (or requesting contract) to ChainLink\u2019s network, and the blockchain processes these requests into their own contracts. These contracts are responsible for matching the requesting contract up with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The first of these, the reputation contract, is exactly as it sounds: it checks an oracle provider\u2019s track record to verify its integrity. In turn, the order-matching contract logs the user contract\u2019s service level agreement on the network and collects bids from responsible oracle providers. Finally, the aggregating contract accumulates the collective data of the chosen oracles and balances them to find the most accurate result.\n\nUnfortunately, the ChainLink team does not offer a roadmap, but a testnet of ChainLink\u2019s services should come sometime within Q1 of 2018. Generally, the project\u2019s general lack of marketing and concrete updates have frustrated community members in the past. Sergey Nazarov, the project\u2019s CEO, is known for a quiet community presence that favors of behind-the-scenes work on ChainLink. The team may not hype their project much, but for what it\u2019s worth, they sacrifice brand marketing in favor of product development\u2013and some community members find this focus to be refreshing. For instance, they\u2019ve established an oracle with Swift Bank, and have a few quiet partnerships with zepplin_os and Request Network.\n\nChainlink has the potential to connect smart contracts with the outside world. It may allow parties to smart contracts to be able to receive external inputs that prove performance and create payment outputs that end users want to receive, such as bank payments. This has the potential to allow smart contract to mimic the vast majority of financial agreements currently available in the market. With the ChainLink Network, anyone can securely provide smart contracts with access to key external data and any other API capabilities, in exchange for financial reward.

After that, every half month,  the benefit, after electricity cost deducted, will be divided 50:50 between the company and customers.

Customer don't have advance knowledge about GPUs and mining technology. Therefore, we would purchase large batch of GPUs for cheaper price and suitable mining spec.\n2. They would like to invest in mining, however large batch of GPUs and mining equipment could take 1-2 months to be transported. We book and prepare all of those in advance by the fund.

There\u2019s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">(Siacoin)</a> to identity verification <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic\">(Civic)</a>. But the original point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nWith a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.\n\nBread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens. $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.\n\nA decentralised banking system was <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin\u2019s</a> original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we\u2019ve become an impatient audience. Whatever the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to do their research and analyse before taking decisions.","id":"bread","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x558ec3152e2eb2174905cd19aea4e34a23de9ad6","https://etherscan.io/token/0x558ec3152e2eb2174905cd19aea4e34a23de9ad6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x558ec3152e2eb2174905cd19aea4e34a23de9ad6"],"facebook_username":"breadapp","homepage":["https://token.breadapp.com/en/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-core"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/breadwallet","twitter_screen_name":"breadapp"},"name":"Bread","symbol":"brd","tickers":[{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BRD","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x5635ddEaBf9cdDA686995Fe90BEB5411831563FC","description":"TravelNote is a business associated with travelling and has been operating since year 2015.

It provides a solution to the scaling problems that developers of decentralized applications (dApps) face while using centralized infrastructure and traditional cloud-based databases.\n\nBluzelle uses reliable \u201dswarm\u201d technology, in which it stores tiny bits of data in groups of nodes or \u201cswarms\u201d which are distributed across the globe. Since this makes it independent of single data centres, Bluzelle\u2019s scaling ability is limitless. Bluzelle adjusts the number of nodes and their location dynamically, reducing request time and improving overall performance. Bluzelle's swarm technology makes it extremely reliable as it redundantly stores pieces of data across the globe, eliminating a single point of failure. Since there are no data centres, Bluzelle\u2019s resources are provided by network \u201cproducers\u201d, who earn funds and pass on the savings to users.\n\nBluzelle held an ICO from January to February 2018, selling 33% of its total supply of 500 million BLZ tokens and earning $19.5 million USD in the process. As of July 2018, Bluzelle has a circulating supply of about 183.02 million BLZ, with an individual price of $0.328 and consequently a market cap of around $60.25 million USD.\n\nThe potential of an endlessly scalable storage service which is quick in its scaling, which is capable of storing any amount of data in a decentralized manner, is one that many investors may have an eye for. BLZ is still new and in its beginning stages, but its experienced team and excellent advisors work in its favour and are indicative of a bright future for the BLZ token. Investing in the token may not give high returns in a short period (since the cryptocurrency is so new and difficult to predict). So some more research is advised.","id":"bluzelle","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x5732046a883704404f284ce41ffadd5b007fd668","https://etherscan.io/token/0x5732046a883704404f284ce41ffadd5b007fd668","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x5732046a883704404f284ce41ffadd5b007fd668"],"homepage":["https://bluzelle.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/njmurarka/bluzelle"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluzelle/","telegram_channel_identifier":"bluzelle","twitter_screen_name":"BluzelleHQ"},"name":"Bluzelle","symbol":"blz","tickers":[{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"gbx","name":"Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"oax","name":"OAX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLZ","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x574F84108a98c575794F75483d801d1d5DC861a5","description":"For the first time in the history, opportunity, technology, as well as legal and social conditions are favourable and ready for the Robotina Platform to step onto the stage.

It will provide fast interexchange settlement, stable trading against ERC-20 assets, and a safe place to park value without the need to settle into fiat. Havven has made significant progress in deploying our network since the completion of the token sale (the largest in Australia at USD$30m) in February 2018. The network is built on the Ethereum blockchain and it employs two tokens, both of which are ERC20 compatible.

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\n\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\n\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.\nIt routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.\n\nIt is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.\n\nAn initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.\n\nFollowing the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.","id":"livepeer","links":{"announcement_url":["https://forum.livepeer.org/","https://medium.com/livepeer-blog"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x58b6a8a3302369daec383334672404ee733ab239","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x58b6a8a3302369daec383334672404ee733ab239"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/RR4kFAh"],"facebook_username":"livepeer","homepage":["https://livepeer.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer","https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs","https://github.com/livepeer/protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/livepeer","twitter_screen_name":"LivepeerOrg"},"name":"Livepeer","symbol":"lpt","tickers":[{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"mxc","name":"MXC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"LPT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x58c69ed6cd6887c0225D1FcCEcC055127843c69b","description":"Through the Internet of things, blockchain technologies and smart contracts, a global halal product ecosystem is established to regulate halal food industry certification system, which aims to trace Halal food, medicine and cosmetics at it's respective origin.","id":"halalchain","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x58c69ed6cd6887c0225d1fccecc055127843c69b","https://etherscan.io/token/0x58c69ed6cd6887c0225d1fccecc055127843c69b","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x58c69ed6cd6887c0225d1fccecc055127843c69b"],"homepage":["http://www.hlc.com/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/halalchain/","twitter_screen_name":"halalchain"},"name":"HalalChain","symbol":"hlc","tickers":[{"base":"HLC","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HLC","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"Probit"},"target":"KRW"}]},{"address":"0x59061b6f26BB4A9cE5828A19d35CFD5A4B80F056","description":"","id":"legends-room","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1874630,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x59061b6f26BB4A9cE5828A19d35CFD5A4B80F056"],"facebook_username":"legendsroom","homepage":["http://www.mre.live"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"legendsroom","twitter_screen_name":"legendsroom"},"name":"Legends Room","symbol":"more","tickers":[{"base":"MORE","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x595832F8FC6BF59c85C527fEC3740A1b7a361269","description":"Power Ledger (POWR) is an Australian blockchain-based cryptocurrency and energy trading platform that allows for decentralized selling and buying of renewable energy. The platform provides consumers with access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.\n\nPower Ledger\u2019s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They\u2019re comprised of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger\u2019s five co-founders make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai\u2019s experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member of Bitfury and Boxer.\n\nPower Ledger\u2019s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD) in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further. (Australia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world and thus has a large stake in the overall success the company).\n\nPower Ledger provides a blockchain-based marketplace that can truly change the world. Taking power away from large energy companies, Power Ledger gives local communities the ability to sell their excess solar power to neighbors.

Eliminating inefficiencies in the cryptomarket, increasing scalability of smart contacts and dapps, sharding, and moving contract execution off-chain are just some of the things that make Aeternity stand out from the crowd. Aeternity powers Turing-complete smart contracts that allow the execution of credible transactions without third parties and intermediaries. It has state channels to make it possible to execute smart contracts off-chain. The blockchain enforces the smart contract code, only in the case of a disagreement between the contracting parties.\n\nIts benefits are for example, high privacy. For many business applications it's crucial to have transactions which are not recorded in public. Smart contracts executed in state channels touch the blockchain only in the case of disagreement, acting like a self-arbitrating crypto court. It has high security too. For example, state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures and unparalleled decentralization provide robust efficiency and eliminate \"\"single point of failure\"\" (SPOF) issues. The cost of buying it very low too. By leveraging state channels as the default way to run smart contracts, \u00e6ternity becomes the most efficient Turing-complete blockchain and thus enables new forms of commerce via its low cost transactions.\n\nAeternity is available on most major exchanges, where it can be traded with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>.

Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\n\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201cimplements all the needed features\u201d to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201d Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\n\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec. They\u2019re quick to note that decentralized cloud storage providers like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/filecoin\">Filecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storj\">Storj</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\">Siacoin</a> are not direct competitors, and it\u2019s easy to see why.  While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">Golem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">SONM</a>. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.  Essentially, they\u2019re both building a decentralized supercomputer on blockchain technology, while iExec is targeting dApp development and sustainability.  Both look towards a future of a blockchain-powered, decentralized internet, but their functions, while sometimes similar, are more complementary than conflicting.","id":"iexec-rlc","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1746241,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x607f4c5bb672230e8672085532f7e901544a7375","https://etherscan.io/token/0x607F4C5BB672230e8672085532f7e901544a7375","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x607f4c5bb672230e8672085532f7e901544a7375"],"facebook_username":"iexecteam","homepage":["http://iex.ec/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/PoCo","https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk","https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-stack"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/iexec","twitter_screen_name":"iEx_ec"},"name":"iExec RLC","symbol":"rlc","tickers":[{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"ethex","name":"Ethex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"WAVES"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"WEUR"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"WUSD"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RLC","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x60C24407d01782C2175D32fe7C8921ed732371D1","description":"LemoChain is a decentralized, open source platform for companies of all sizes to monetize and exchange their structured business data.

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\n\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\n\nQASH is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">ERC20</a> token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">Ripple XRP token</a>. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> specializing in alternative coins or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini\">Gemini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gdax\">Coinbase</a> focusing on fiat to crypto conversions.\n\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was\npreviously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA). The Liquid platform is actually the result of combining two previous platforms, Quoinex and Qryptos. At one time, those two trading platforms were performing over $12 billion of transactions each year.","id":"qash","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2256844,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x618e75ac90b12c6049ba3b27f5d5f8651b0037f6","https://etherscan.io/token/0x618e75ac90b12c6049ba3b27f5d5f8651b0037f6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x618e75ac90b12c6049ba3b27f5d5f8651b0037f6"],"facebook_username":"QUOINE.SG","homepage":["https://liquid.plus/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/QASH","telegram_channel_identifier":"QUOINE","twitter_screen_name":"quoine_SG"},"name":"QASH","symbol":"qash","tickers":[{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cex","name":"CEX.IO"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cex","name":"CEX.IO"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"QSH","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QSH","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"CNY"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"HKD"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"IDR"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"QASH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"PHP"},{"base":"CHI","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"FTX","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"DREAM","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"AMLT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"MITX","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"GAT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"ADH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"FLIXX","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"BRC","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"DRG","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"CMCT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"IPSX","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"FDX","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"UKG","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"CAN","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"DACS","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"PLC","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"PWV","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"IDH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"ZPR","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"SGN","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"ELY","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"VIO","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"LIKE","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"STU","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"MGO","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"XNK","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"ONT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"FLP","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"RKT","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":

The appearance of COZP coins naturally attracted the attention and support of investors, and it was ranked among the top in Korea and the global rankings in less than one year. COZP use the PoT and PoS mechanisms, it is mining and airdrop. Users who adopt the PoT mechanism can obtain COZP compensation according to the fee payment ratio. Users who adopt the PoS mechanism and hold the COZP can obtain partial (70%) transaction fee compensation in the form of BTC and ETH. In order to differentiate the exchange, the platform not only limits the daily circulation of COZP, but also uses the method of distributing mining revenue by transaction contribution (transaction contribution = user daily transaction amount / exchange daily transaction amount). Most of the Korean exchanges recently launched have adopted the COZP mining and Air Drop mode, making COZP currency the most representative token in Korea. Now, COZP coins are aimed at global users, and the liquidity and price stability of tokens are gradually moving towards the center of the token economy.

The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we\u2019re just going to focus on their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events.\n\nUsers in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia is Gnosis\u2019s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product, so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a beta version in December 2017 but haven\u2019t announced a date for the main net release. The Management Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis\u2019s prediction markets. It\u2019s here that you check your balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.\n\nGnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren\u2019t minting any additional ones. These are the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL usage over the previous 3 months.\n\nThe Gnosis team is led by Martin K\u00f6ppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO). K\u00f6ppelmann and George began working on the platform in January 2015 as one of the first ConsenSys partners. By August of that same year, they launched the alpha product as the first major dapp on Ethereum. In April 2017, the project held somewhat of a controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/gnosis\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>. Using a dutch auction style of raising funds, the team hit their $12.5 million hard cap in ten minutes while retaining 95% of the tokens. Amidst backlash, the team locked the tokens in a vault and have promised not to dump them on the market. They\u2019ll give at least a three-month warning before selling any of the tokens. The team includes quite a list of reputable advisors including Joseph Lubin (Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder and chief scientist).","id":"gnosis","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1529098,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96","https://etherscan.io/token/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96"],"facebook_username":"Gnosis.pm","homepage":["https://gnosis.pm/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis.js"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gnosisPM","twitter_screen_name":"gnosisPM"},"name":"Gnosis","symbol":"gno","tickers":[{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"credoex","name":"CredoEx"},"target":"CREDO"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"EUR"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"TRY"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"65998168-6996-4EF1-88AD-246591316C7D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"65998168-6996-4EF1-88AD-246591316C7D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"orderbook","name":"Orderbook.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"poloniex","name":"Poloniex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"poloniex","name":"Poloniex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar

Solarin was their first project, which gained popularity as the most secure phone in the world. Though it was a success and was endorsed by famous celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, the company declared a layoff of about one-third of the staff by 2015. The reason they announced was developments in other fields. In late 2017, Sirin Labs announced the ICO (Initial Public Offering) of Sirin Lab Token (SRN) in order to give their operations a new direction. Now, they focus on bringing new technology for mass adoption.\n\nSIRIN Labs has a vision of creating open source and secure devices for mass adoption. The biggest problem SRN tokens face is convincing average users of smartphone that a high security phone is worth investing in! If SRN tokens follow the recent trends and other products by SIRIN Labs become a success, then that day is not away when SRN token will be one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.

In Blockcloud, SCN forms the underlying physical network that provides connectivity, mobility and scalability. The blockchain logically operates on top of SCN to provide decentralized trust, security, fairness and economic incentive.\n\nAn blockchain-based advanced TCP/IP architecture connecting every dots of your life. The Blockcloud ICO and BLOC Token offer a solution to the challenges of scalability and trust stifling the growth of the IoT sector. On a traditional IoT network, most platforms provide a centralized server to aggregate all connected devices, data, and services. Such structuring ultimately creates barriers to scaling through high-bandwidth consumption and a centralized point of failure.\n\nAs a solution to these problems, Blockcloud propose an incentive-driven protocol for IoT services, architected for scalability and security, that will form the foundation of a viable ecosystem of interconnected smart devices.\n\nBlockcloud contend that blockchain technology offers the most viable means to introduce the mechanisms for incentivization and trust necessary for a functional IoT ecosystem. The protocol will include an application-layer overlay on top of the underlying network of connected devices, utilizing Service-Centric Networking (SCN). In essence, Service-Centric Networks (SCN) provide the mechanisms required to deploy replicated service instances across a distributed network, routing client requests (i.e. from IoT connected devices) to the closest instance while maintaining the most efficient usage of the network infrastructure.\n\nThe Blockcloud ICO offers a well-positioned project targeting the rapidly growing IoT industry. The domain expertise of the team and track record of success lend a high degree of credibility to their proposed solution for a decentralized IoT ecosystem.\n\nWith a long list of partnerships and strong community support for an early stage project, the Blockcloud ICO is showing signs of a bright future ahead.","id":"blockcloud","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/blockcloud-official"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x6f919d67967a97ea36195a2346d9244e60fe0ddb","https://etherscan.io/token/0x6f919d67967a97ea36195a2346d9244e60fe0ddb","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6f919d67967a97ea36195a2346d9244e60fe0ddb"],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/gBSkoVR"],"facebook_username":"Blockcloud-605495993154497","homepage":["https://www.block-cloud.io"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"BlockcloudTeam","twitter_screen_name":"BlockcloudTeam"},"name":"Blockcloud","symbol":"bloc","tickers":[{"base":"BLOC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BLOC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BLOC","market":{"identifier":"hpx","name":"HPX"},"target":"CNYT"},{"base":"BLOC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x6Fd1DaDA61F2D210A1E4e47b672f73bc851862f9","description":"Eesty Coin is Ethereum ERC20 token and is the Inventors crowdfunding platform coin.

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\n\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\n\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain\u2019s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\n\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.\n\nThe developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there\u2019s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.\n\nArthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80\u2019s and have been working on Holu since before the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company\u2019s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.","id":"holotoken","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/h-o-l-o"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2963267,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2","https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2"],"facebook_username":"holohost","homepage":["https://holo.host/","https://holochain.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Holochain/holochain-proto","https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust","https://github.com/holochain/holochain-ui","https://github.com/holochain/holosqape"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/holochain","telegram_channel_identifier":"channelholo","twitter_screen_name":"h_o_l_o_"},"name":"Holo","symbol":"hot","tickers":[{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOLO","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOLO","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"bilaxy","name":"Bilaxy"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"coinasset","name":"CoinAsset"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"coinbig","name":"COINBIG"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"coinplace","name":"Coinplace"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"daybit","name":"Daybit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"daybit","name":"Daybit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOLO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOLO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"WBTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"ooobtc","name":"OOOBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"orderbook","name":"Orderbook.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"orderbook","name":"Orderbook.io"},"target":"OUSD"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HOT","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar

The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi\u2019s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binancecoin\">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>. The creation of BNB secured Binance\u2019s place as the world\u2019s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\n\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, \u201cnot an ICO,\u201d due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi\u2019s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\n\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That\u2019s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.\n\nHuobi isn\u2019t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox (BIX)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kucoin-shares\">KuCoin (KCS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coss\">Coss (COSS)</a> have all issued their own tokens as well.","id":"huobi-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161","https://etherscan.io/token/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161"],"chat_url":["https://weibo.com/huobicom"],"homepage":["https://www.hbg.com"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/huobi/","telegram_channel_identifier":"huobiglobalofficial","twitter_screen_name":"HuobiGlobal"},"name":"Huobi Token","symbol":"ht","tickers":[{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"coinbig","name":"COINBIG"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"HPT","market":{"identifier":"huobi","name":"Huobi Global"},"target":"HT"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"HT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0x6fB3e0A217407EFFf7Ca062D46c26E5d60a14d69","description":"IoTeX is the auto-scalable and privacy-centric blockchain infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT).

Today, anybody can become a cryptocurrency investor or trader with a minimum investment. This has brought many newcomers to cryptocurrency markets who did not reviously possess the technical know-how in currency trading. For instance, a taxi driver or a pianist can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies and ICOs in their spare time with a small amount of funds and make higher returns than with traditional market retail investment applications.\n\nSuccessful cryptocurrency traders have one thing in common - they do not guess. To make consistently positive returns, they dedicate days, if not weeks, researching their first currency purchase. It can take them months or years to develop technical and market specific knowledge to invest in multiple cryptorelated assets effectively. It is important to note that this time is not free - aside from forfeited work and personal activities, this time can often mean missed opportunities, when an investor has been too slow to capitalize on profitable opportunities.\n\nThis is where WatermelonBlock comes in - making cryptocurrency, ICO investment and trading simple enough to fit any lifestyle, while being smarter and faster than traditional investment analysis.\n\nAs part of its Phase I implementation, WatermelonBlock will provide actionable insights in real time while making the whole investing and trading process simple, easy, reliable and trustworthy. This will be done with the help of proprietary algorithms and the robust, scalable processing power of IBM Watson Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nWatermelonBlock\u201a s phase II implementation, targeted to be launched in the third quarter of 2019, intends to analyze information which would take human minds hundreds and thousands of hours to process. This makes the process faster, more efficient and accurate using AI and machine learning that factor in behavioral finance and economic methods of analysis. WatermelonBlock will be able to cleverly analyze market sentiment by combining technical and social big data sets. Utilizing the efficacy of AI, WatermelonBlock will not be vulnerable to the biases of any particular investor, group or strategy.","id":"watermelonblock","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@watermelonblock"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4565675,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x7a18919f0b05fa5e91f3ef43afe8a72105c9d4b8"],"facebook_username":"watermelonblock","homepage":["https://watermelonblock.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/WatermelonBlock/","telegram_channel_identifier":"WMBcommunity","twitter_screen_name":"watermelonblock"},"name":"WatermelonBlock","symbol":"wmb","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x7a3d3c4f30c46F51b814BEe23D970A7c9b757a32","description":"ASGARD is a decentralized cryptoecological fund, which provides crypto currency funding for specific environmental tasks.

Once the EOS platform launches, the ERC20 token contract will be frozen and the ledger will be transferred over to EOS through a process, defined by the launch team, that will be described on the eosDAC website and social media channels.\n\nBlockMaker Ltd has created a total token supply for eosDAC of 1,200,000,000. These tokens represent the community members of eosDAC, who will own and control the DAC (Decentralised Autonomous Community) once it is launched on the EOS blockchain in June 2018. EosDAC will seek to have it\u2019s tokens listed on a number of major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n75% of eosDAC tokens (900,000,000) have been allocated for an airdrop to EOS token holders. All EOS token holders holding over 100 tokens* at the end of Day 300 of the EOS crowdsale (April 15th 2018, 01:00:00 UTC) will receive 1 eosDAC token for each EOS token that they hold, these tokens will be transferred directly into their Ethereum (ERC20 compatible) wallet. The actual airdrop will be made as soon as possible after this date and after we have run necessary tests and checks.\n\nAll Ethereum accounts that have 100 or more EOS tokens in them at the snapshot on the 15th April will automatically receive the airdrop. Any accounts with less than 100 tokens will not automatically receive the airdrop but will be eligible (until 15th May 2018) to apply using eosdac.io/airdrop.\n\nWhile eosDAC will now include Crypto Exchange wallets in the airdrop, you will need to contact your exchange directly to check that they will distribute the eosDAC tokens to an eosDAC wallet under your control. If your exchange is not prepared to do this you would need to withdraw your EOS tokens to an exchange that does support the eosDAC airdrop, or better still to an ethereum address for which you have the private key. Most exchanges will support airdrop distributions as long as they receive enough customers requesting them to.","id":"eosdac","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x7e9e431a0b8c4d532c745b1043c7fa29a48d4fba","https://etherscan.io/token/0x7e9e431a0b8c4d532c745b1043c7fa29a48d4fba","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x7e9e431a0b8c4d532c745b1043c7fa29a48d4fba"],"homepage":["https://eosdac.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/eosdac/"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EOSDAC/","twitter_screen_name":"eosdac"},"name":"eosDAC","symbol":"eosdac","tickers":[{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BIX"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"coinmex","name":"CoinMex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"daybit","name":"Daybit"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"k_kex","name":"KKEX"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"BITCNY"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"BITUSD"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"BTS"},{"base":"ETH","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"EOSDAC"},{"base":"EOS","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"EOSDAC"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"otcbtc","name":"OTCBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"Probit"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"six_x","name":"6x"},"target":"USDX"},{"base":"EOSDAC","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0x7f288Ff5A8055F5f6103A80Dd806cf8415e035C7","description":"Chain Finance project, launched by Chain Finance Corp CO., LTD., aiming to create the first eco-industry union platform for blockchain business and finance, and then formulate the related consensus mechanism and standard order to promote the healthy and sustainable development of blockchain industry.\n\nChain Finance Corp CO.,LTD., headquartered in London, is an integrated service provider of blockchain financial data and information.

Aave strives to break through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. Aave also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\n\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call. \n\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a \u2018My Loan\u2019 section, collectible badges and more.

Its chief mission is to develop and research blockchain solutions that can be used for a global village ecosystem, and to provide funding and technological support for the development and maintenance of blockchain technology and the operation of ecosystems for related businesses.\n\nThe GlobalVillage Ecosystem team is an internationalized blockchain technology and operation team comprising members from countries such as China and the US. Through research into the social environment of villages in multiple countries, the team discovered that villages and cities have major differences. Villages are mainly acquaintance societies which have gradually formed semi-closed social networks characterized by blood relations, human relationships, and the pattern of difference sequence. These kinds of social relationships have limited the development of villages, as well as curbed their economic growth.\n\nIt is precisely those limitations of village society that the GlobalVillage Ecosystem Foundation saw when it decided to start off with the establishment and maintenance of village networks, in order to gradually set up a distributed, coordinated blockchain network based in villages around the world, with peer-to-peer task allocation and reliable identity verification.\n\nIn the GlobalVillage Ecosystem blockchain network, the distributed task-allocation system uses task-confirmation certificates to record the execution and feedback of tasks on the chain, and the service system uses rights certificates to record the confirmation and reception of service on the blockchain. Furthermore, a reliable, smart contract and transaction system uses transaction and exchange certificates to record exchanges of property on the chain.\n\nThe credibility of the GlobalVillage Ecosystem network ecosystem comes from the transparency of its event records; the key to this is that the maintenance of the global network system is based on a distributed form of operation, creating a globalized applied ecology. During the distributed operation of the network system, members who are carrying out maintenance on the network system can use GlobalVillage Ecosystem\u2019s digital service layer to freely, efficiently, and transparently participate in verification and assessment work regarding task allocation, task execution, content transmission, and message and transaction confirmation.","id":"globalvillage-ecosystem","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x81705082ef9f0d660f07be80093d46d826d48b25","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x81705082ef9f0d660f07be80093d46d826d48b25"],"facebook_username":"andy.hu.16547008","homepage":["http://gve.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"gv_eco"},"name":"Globalvillage Ecosystem","symbol":"gve","tickers":[{"base":"GVE","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GVE","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GVE","market":{"identifier":"coinbig","name":"COINBIG"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GVE","market":{"identifier":"rfinex","name":"Rfinex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x818Fc6C2Ec5986bc6E2CBf00939d90556aB12ce5","description":"Kin is a decentralized cryptocurrency token issued on Ethereum, an open-source public blockchain. It was created by Kik Interactive in September 2017 in a token distribution event, raising over $98 million from 10,000 participants. The purpose of the token is to facilitate value transfers in digital services such as gaming applications and social media, and will initially be launched on the Kik messenger to leverage the application's 15 million monthly active users. Use of Kin over other tokens is incentivised by providing a daily reward to developers of these digital services based on their usage.\n\nKik\u2019s latest effort has been allowing users to reward creators directly. Today\u2019s digital content and social media companies monetize their websites using advertising. This model requires that these companies go after economies of scale, adding new users quickly. They also want new users to spend as much time as possible on their platform so they can maximize ad views and therefore revenue. The leadership at Kik believes this trend toward the attention economy is a mistake. Their philosophical argument for creating a cryptocurrency is that advertising and attention seeking is cheapening the content ecosystem and our relationships. Using Kin Coin, they hope to enable consumers to pay creators and developers directly. This crowdsourced patronage is an important trend in social media. We\u2019re seeing similar projects that have gained traction with the likes of Kickstarter or Patreon. These services allow people to pay creators directly, without the need for advertisers.\n\nKik needed further funding in 2017. Instead of raising money from venture capitalists, they decided to launch an ICO to create the token behind their new rewards points system. The token sale for Kin Coin was a success, raising $98 million in September 2017. The sale included over 10,000 people from 117 countries. Unfortunately, Canadian citizens were not allowed to participate, and Kik is a Canadian company. Some argue this dampened demand and contributed to the ICO not reaching its hard cap of $110 million. A total of 10 trillion KIN will exist, of which 750 billion are currently in circulation. The token launched on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>.\n\nKin Coin will launch on Kik later this year. The idea is for monetization to integrate seamlessly into the app. Users should be able to reward creators simply from their wallets with a few taps. Kin Coin is designed to be mobile-first, and a wallet app will arrive in the coming months as well. A few test users can use Kin Coin right now on Kik. The only thing you can do so far is buy some custom digital stickers for use in chats. Expect more features upon launch later this year. Over time, the idea is to allow other digital services and media applications to also integrate KIN. It won\u2019t be exclusive to Kik. However, Kik will be the first company to launch Kin Coin integration.\n\nKIN\u2019s value decreased following the ICO as hype died down. In January, KIN rode the wave along with much of the cryptocurrency market to an all-time high. Since January, the price has fallen, but never to pre-January levels. KIN is an ERC-20 token, so you can store it anywhere that accepts Ethereum. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect?locale=en\">MyEtherWallet</a> is a good option for paper storage. Of course, a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet is the gold standard for security. Kin has the backing of a major startup with a large active user base. This is an interesting opportunity to see how well crypto integrates with an existing community, especially a younger community who might not care about crypto. They just want things to work well. Solving the problem of giving crypto a great user experience is an important step to making crypto useful. If Kik can figure that out with the Kin Coin then this will be an interesting project to follow.","id":"kin","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x818fc6c2ec5986bc6e2cbf00939d90556ab12ce5","https://etherscan.io/token/0x818fc6c2ec5986bc6e2cbf00939d90556ab12ce5","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x818fc6c2ec5986bc6e2cbf00939d90556ab12ce5"],"homepage":["http://kinecosystem.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-devplatform-android","https://github.com/kinecosystem/kin-ecosystem-android-sdk"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/KinFoundation","twitter_screen_name":"kin_foundation"},"name":"Kin","symbol":"kin","tickers":[{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"allbit","name":"Allbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"LTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"coinall","name":"CoinAll"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"coinfalcon","name":"Coinfalcon"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"coinfalcon","name":"Coinfalcon"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"FAT"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"GUSD"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"PAX"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"568637D4-2B03-4F66-972E-B947A40F2771","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"568637D4-2B03-4F66-972E-B947A40F2771","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"568637D4-2B03-4F66-972E-B947A40F2771","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"mercatox","name":"Mercatox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"otcbtc","name":"OTCBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"otcbtc","name":"OTCBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"SATX"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"KIN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0x81b4D08645DA11374a03749AB170836E4e539767","description":"Paymon suggests its own view of standard Blockchain, introducing ways of\ndealing with most issues of existing cryptocurrencies: the scaling problem, archaic architecture, low speed, and high transaction fees.

Instead of wasting electricity and computing power on hashes like Bitcoin does, PoUW uses these resources towards useful work tasks provided by enterprises and consumers. The protocol runs on SGX-enabled CPUs with remote attestation to ensure security and confidentiality. The novel PoUW approach unlocks the massive potential of idle computing power around the world by providing enough incentives: in this scheme, every computation contributor gets compensated, and some will get the extra reward for generating the blocks. In the future, this mining scheme can promote Universal Basic Income (UBI).\n\nPlasma Sidechains\nThe Multi-chain Plasma implementation allows different applications to handle application-specific smart contracts on individual side chains, preventing transactions from overloading the PoUW-based main chain.\n\nNative Oracle Service\nNative Oracle Service (NOS) provides authenticated data feed by leveraging both cryptographic primitives and the trusted execution environment (TEE).

They believe that for someone to be able to understand the technology and use any such platform should have advanced technical skills.\n\nVOISE addresses these apprehensions by providing an easy to use interface and support for multiple cryptocurrencies as well as fiat to make it as good as any other conventional music streaming service out there in today\u2019s market. The team behind VOISE have conducted extensive research into the industry to identify the problems. They are implementing these learnings to develop a platform that can address most of the issues. The VOISE ecosystem is powered by its own VOISE ERC20 tokens, which acts as\nthe primary mode of transaction on the platform.\n\nThe main objective of VOISE team is to create a platform that can serve the purposes of both the artists and users. The platform built over Ethereum protocol makes use of smart contracts for automation and provides an easy and cost-effective way to sell and stream music. Unlike other similar platforms, VOISE incorporates a simple yet efficient user interface that allows the users to browse and listen to music just the way they have been doing on conventional music platform. The multi cryptocurrency and fiat support makes the platform even more convenient for the users.\n\nVOISE is one of the successful cryptocurrency projects of 2017. The platform has introduced blockchain technology into the music industry to encourage the growth of the ecosystem while solving some of the issues regarding the well-being of the artist community. At the same time, the VOISE team has also made it their mission to promote the use of cryptocurrencies among the general public.

The initiators of the project have set a goal \u2014 to decentralize the process of business expansion and take it beyond the framework of traditional partnerships.\n\nThe Bananacoin Project will facilitate wider recognition of blockchain technology on the commodity market, forming a close connection with blockchain communities \u2014 Bitcoin, Ethereum, WAVES and others. Bananacoin will create tokens using blockchain (Ethereum), and tokens will be emitted based on the export price of 1 kilogram of bananas.\n\nProject Description\nBananacoin is blockchain project aiming to achieve a core modification of the global banana production industry, similar to how Uber has revolutionized the taxi industry or how Upwork has brought freelancing to a new level. In short, the initiators of the project create processes in the production of organic bananas through the implementation of an economic element in the seemingly completely understood export relations of the product.\n\nBananacoin is using the proven TGE crowdfunding model, allowing backers to invest in expansion of production and become holders of Bananacoin tokens (BCO), which can be exchanged after project launch for goods or funds and are expected to more than double in value in 18 months\u2019 time.\n\nAfter the realisation of the project, Bananacoin tokens will be exchangeable for a certain amount of Lady Finger bananas or equivalent monetary compensation. Because the token is backed by the market value of 1 kilogram of bananas, participants can be certain of the success of the project, as the demand for bananas is constant. Furthermore, Lady Finger bananas are considered to be among the best banana varieties, and the environmentally friendly technologies used in our project ensure that the good will remain an attractive investment and that its price will grow constantly","id":"bananacoin","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2112748,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x865d176351f287fe1b0010805b110d08699c200a","https://etherscan.io/token/0x865d176351f287fe1b0010805b110d08699c200a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x865d176351f287fe1b0010805b110d08699c200a"],"facebook_username":"bananacoinENG","homepage":["https://www.bananacoin.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/banana-coin/website"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"bananacoineng","twitter_screen_name":"Bananacoin_Eng"},"name":"BananaCoin","symbol":"bco","tickers":[{"base":"BCO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"BCO","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BCO","market":{"identifier":"thetokenstore","name":"Token.Store"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x865bfD8232778F00CAe81315bf75ef1Fe6E30CDD","description":"ABLE is a financial platform of cryptocurrency. ABLE\u2019s P2P loan matching engine and DEX based mutual fund platform solve current tradition banking and investing problem. Blockchain technology enable to connect global investors and entrepreneurs regardless of border in a reliable way.\n\nThe ABLE project has been proposed to provide an alternative to banks\u2019 conventional lendingdeposit spread structure, and to solve problems with initial cryptocurrency banking services.\n\nBy developing a matching engine that connects investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer basis, the project directly connects investors and borrowers without any intermediaries. With intermediaries and lending spreads eliminated, cryptocurrency interest rates will be determined by mutual agreement between users in a free market, and said rates will serve as market interest rates. Investors can receive higher interests than they would in a centralized market, while borrowers can lend money at lower rates, creating a win-win scenario. Since investing and lending occur governed by smart contracts, the project will eliminate exposure to managers\u2019 moral hazard and the risk of central-server hacking.\n\nCurrent cryptocurrency banking services provide deposits and loans separately rather than linking depositors and borrowers. The services have shortcomings such as inability to provide high deposit interest rates in a sustainable way. Such services cannot mitigate or eliminate intermediary risks because their structure is based on a centralized model. On the other hand, the ABLE project directly links users, primarily through an account, and enables a variety of financial activities such as payroll and investment, based on smart contracts.\n\nThe ABLE project primarily aims to apply decentralized blockchain technology to financial and wealth management features; to directly link demand and supply through an account on a peer-to-peer basis; and to establish a reliable system. It aims subsequently to build an in-house decentralized exchange, and then to evolve into a platform on which to develop and use smart contracts for finance and wealth management services.","id":"able","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@ableproject","https://www.linkedin.com/company/able-bank/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3159298,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x865bfd8232778f00cae81315bf75ef1fe6e30cdd","https://etherscan.io/token/0x865bfd8232778f00cae81315bf75ef1fe6e30cdd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x865bfd8232778f00cae81315bf75ef1fe6e30cdd"],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/gMsFwKM"],"facebook_username":"ablecoinproject","homepage":["https://www.able-project.io/en/index.php?lang=en"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/kblockchain/able-platform"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ABLEproject/","telegram_channel_identifier":"ABLE_Project_EN","twitter_screen_name":"Ablecoinproject"},"name":"ABLE X Token","symbol":"ablx","tickers":[{"base":"ABLX","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ABLX","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"Probit"},"target":"KRW"}]},{"address":"0x865e3707a580F9db89304005CddD050Ade8873eB","description":"HireMatch.io is patent pending decentralized employment marketplace that doesn't rely on traditional recruiters or \"headhunters\".

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD\u200a\u2014\u200aevery Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\n\n*Features of Dai:\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\n\n*How Dai Works?\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal\u200a\u2014\u200aa token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\n\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1\u200a\u2014\u200ait is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\n\n*How is Dai Created?\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\n\nFirst, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\n\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\n\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\n\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so\u200a\u2014\u200amargin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\n\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created.","id":"dai","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x89d24a6b4ccb1b6faa2625fe562bdd9a23260359","https://etherscan.io/token/0x89d24a6b4ccb1b6faa2625fe562bdd9a23260359","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x89d24a6b4ccb1b6faa2625fe562bdd9a23260359"],"homepage":["https://makerdao.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/makerdao/auction-keeper","https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js","https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO","twitter_screen_name":"MakerDAO"},"name":"Dai","symbol":"dai","tickers":[{"base":"BTC","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BTC","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"ETH","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"ICX","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"BAT","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"GVT","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"bitbegin","name":"Bitbegin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"coinchangex","name":"Coinchangex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"coinsuper","name":"Coinsuper"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"credoex","name":"CredoEx"},"target":"CREDO"},{"base":"WETH","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"MKR","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"WBTC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"USDC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"OMG","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"ZRX","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"TUSD","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"ethex","name":"Ethex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MKR","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"OMG","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"FAT","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"fatbtc","name":"FatBTC"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"DAI","market":{"identifier":"gbx","name":"Gibraltar

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\n\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\n\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\n\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex\">OKEx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gate\">Gate.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/zb\">ZB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin\">KuCoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/digifinex\">DigiFinex</a>. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether\">Tether</a>. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\n\nThe Paxos Standard (PAX) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.","id":"paxos-standard","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@PaxosStandard"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1","https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1"],"homepage":["https://www.paxos.com/standard/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/paxosglobal/pax-contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"PaxosStandard"},"name":"Paxos Standard","symbol":"pax","tickers":[{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"bcex","name":"BCEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"coinmex","name":"CoinMex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"coinsuper","name":"Coinsuper"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"digifinex","name":"Digifinex"},"target":"USDC"},{"base":"PAX","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0x8E91A9cBAdB74EF60c456f1E4Ba3E391b143AAD9","description":"Optical Network, the first P2P network that does not require infrastructure or network connectivity, and a network infrastructure sharing system based on blockchain peer-to-peer technology development, allows users to share unlimited signals across devices in a blockchain network, enabling full global network coverage.","id":"optical-network","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e91a9cbadb74ef60c456f1e4ba3e391b143aad9"],"homepage":["http://www.optc.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"OPTCfoundation"},"name":"Optical Network","symbol":"optc","tickers":[]},{"address":"0x8EFF575359d56005B816028384C2b386dCB20015","description":"IBC IS A GLOBAL, PEER-TO-PEER DISTRIBUTED DATA STORAGE AND SHARING SYSTEM.

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\n\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\n\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\n\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.","id":"singularitynet","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2491147,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285","https://etherscan.io/token/0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285"],"facebook_username":"singularityNET.io","homepage":["https://singularitynet.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/singnet/singnet"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SingularityNetsub/","telegram_channel_identifier":"singularitynet","twitter_screen_name":"singularity_net"},"name":"SingularityNET","symbol":"agi","tickers":[{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"5EDFC49B-F3F6-4827-A2EC-0B40F301973B","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"5EDFC49B-F3F6-4827-A2EC-0B40F301973B","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AGI","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x8eFFd494eB698cc399AF6231fCcd39E08fd20B15","description":"We are building the first blockchain based \u2018image mining\u2019 network for augmented reality or any other computer vision system, such as the Lampix product.

allows users complete control over their crypto assets and offers the opportunity to purchase crypto with regular currencies.\n\nThe Hash Algorithmic Technologies (HAT) ecosystem is designed to cater to the needs of the average person. It's vision is to bring the benefits of crypto to the global audience using a simple, intuitive and reliable application. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, it aims to offer support for all ERC-20 tokens and major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, LTC.\n\nIn order to provide users easy access to purchasing crypto, the HAT.CashCards will act like prepaid cards allowing users to simply load fiat money into their HAT.Wallet, which can then be used to purchase HAT tokens. Despite being an exchange, HAT does not hold user assets. All information is stored on user's device and encrypted for security.\n\nCash Cards\nHAT.CashCards let users purchase prepaid codes locally or online with the payment options available to them. Once the value is redeemed, it can be spent on purchasing either HAT tokens or BTC, LTC and ETH. Cash Cards are the cornerstone of true mass adoption, enabling users in territories with less advanced financial systems to buy into crypto with incredible ease.\n\nStaking with HAT.Wallet\nThe HAT.Wallet functions as an independent application, allowing users to stake their HAT tokens on the Ethereum network. The process is instant and incurs a small gas fee (charged in ETH). Staking is a crucial part of the IFS rewards system where users can earn HAT tokens, as rewards, at a fixed ARR every year.\n\nThe IFS model will continue to drop rewards to 'stakers' until the 7 million hard cap is reached. Once the total supply is achieved, users can continue to stake their tokens and receive rewards from the pool of tokens gathered through transaction fees. The IFS model is designed to offer rewards for an indefinite period of time. Interactions on the blockchain, such as adding and withdrawing stake or claiming rewards, incur small fees in ETH as gas.","id":"hawala-today","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2285591,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9002d4485b7594e3e850f0a206713b305113f69e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9002d4485b7594e3e850f0a206713b305113f69e"],"facebook_username":"hawalatoday","homepage":["https://hat.exchange/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/HATexchangeCommunity/","telegram_channel_identifier":"hat_public","twitter_screen_name":"HAT_Exchange"},"name":"HAT Token","symbol":"hat","tickers":[{"base":"HAT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x900b4449236a7bb26b286601dD14d2bDe7a6aC6c","description":"The goal of the project is to combine the strengths of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency with years of experience creating Environmental Sustainability Solutions to establish a global Natural Asset Marketplace that removes current barriers to participation in activities that preserve our Environment, while providing all stakeholders with tangible assets that appreciate in value as the market matures and grows.\n\nThe impactChoice Natural Asset Exchange blockchain platform and Earth Token (EARTH) will accelerate global Environmental Sustainability efforts and transform the $120 Trillion Natural Capital Asset Market by allowing the market to grow organically and achieve its massive potential.\n\nEarth Token (EARTH) funds will be held using multi-sig wallets, including two of three signatories for the control of funds.","id":"earth-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x900b4449236a7bb26b286601dd14d2bde7a6ac6c","https://etherscan.io/token/0x900b4449236a7bb26b286601dd14d2bde7a6ac6c","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x900b4449236a7bb26b286601dd14d2bde7a6ac6c"],"homepage":["https://earth-token.com/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthToken/"},"name":"Earth Token","symbol":"earth","tickers":[{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"satoexchange","name":"SatoExchange"},"target":"SATX"},{"base":"EARTH","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x9041Fe5B3FDEA0f5e4afDC17e75180738D877A01","description":"Prochain next-gen decentralized digital advertising ecosystem.

Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee.\n\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based ERC20 token.\n\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\n\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.","id":"cardstack","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/cardstack"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2768237,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x954b890704693af242613edef1b603825afcd708","https://etherscan.io/token/0x954b890704693af242613edef1b603825afcd708","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x954b890704693af242613edef1b603825afcd708"],"facebook_username":"cardstackproject","homepage":["https://cardstack.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack","https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack-auth0","https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack-token"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cardstack","telegram_channel_identifier":"cardstack","twitter_screen_name":"cardstack"},"name":"Cardstack","symbol":"card","tickers":[{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BIX"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"BCH"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"coinsuper","name":"Coinsuper"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CARD","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x956Ff273D0AB5Cceeba832BfCF0F342F61c71388","description":"The KC Chain (referred to as KCC) develops a stylized loan contract management protocol based on the Ethereum (ETH) project.

The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that\u2019s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain.\n\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn\u2019t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don\u2019t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a \u201cBest Underage European Programmer\u201d award, and he\u2019s a recipient of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 recognition. He\u2019s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\n\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It\u2019s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company\u2019s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company\u2019s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company\u2019s requirements.\n\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn\u2019t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they\u2019re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn\u2019t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\n\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform.

As a apps platform, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> has proven its security time and again. However, apps and smart contracts on top of Ethereum may still have bugs in which malicious players can cause havoc on the network. The two most notable examples of these being the $55 million DAO hack and the $30 million Parity wallet bug. These issues not only affect the people who\u2019ve had their funds stolen, but they also diminish the credibility of the entire ecosystem.\n\nQuantstamp is making smart contracts more secure through automated software testing and a system of bug bounties. Although starting with Ethereum, the team is building the protocol to be available on any DApp platform in the long run.In an industry where security is a primary concern and bugs have caused the theft of millions of dollars, Quantstamp should help to legitimize blockchain projects and ensure that large-scale smart contract hacks are a thing of the past.\n\nQuantstamp held a successful ICO in November 2017 in which the team raised a little over $30 million dollars. They distributed 650 million (65%) QSP out of the 1 billion total supply to ICO participants at a price of $0.072 per token. After the usual post-ICO volatility, the QSP price stabilized at around $0.10 (~0.000005 BTC) through the end of November. The price followed the trend of the altcoin market and rose rapidly to an all-time high of $0.82 (~0.000051 BTC) before slowly falling to its current price of ~$0.286. The QSP price weathered the beginning of the year market downfall better than most other altcoins.","id":"quantstamp","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2220795,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x99ea4db9ee77acd40b119bd1dc4e33e1c070b80d","https://etherscan.io/token/0x99ea4db9ee77acd40b119bd1dc4e33e1c070b80d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x99ea4db9ee77acd40b119bd1dc4e33e1c070b80d"],"facebook_username":"quantstamp","homepage":["https://quantstamp.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/quantstamp/token-distribution"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Quantstamp","twitter_screen_name":"Quantstamp"},"name":"Quantstamp","symbol":"qsp","tickers":[{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"bitbox","name":"BITBOX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"bitbox","name":"BITBOX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"QSP","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x9A2681935C2775b7ABF0649ec5c306EEA7561930","description":"EOPT, OR EASYOPTION TOKEN IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY CREATED BY EASYOPTION.\n\nEASYOPTION IS THE MOST ADVANCED CRYPTO-ASSETS OPTIONS TRADING PLATFORM IN THE WORLD.","id":"easyoption-token","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3641637,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a2681935c2775b7abf0649ec5c306eea7561930"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/h2H8qmw"],"facebook_username":"EasyOption2018","homepage":["https://www.easyoption.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"easyoption","twitter_screen_name":"EasyOption_io"},"name":"EasyOption Token","symbol":"eopt","tickers":[{"base":"EOPT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x9A2D74eA6ee7904E277803a6fdf9Edea5e858E2c","description":"","id":"cashierest-affiliate-program-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a2d74ea6ee7904e277803a6fdf9edea5e858e2c"],"homepage":["https://www.cashierest.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"cashierest_info"},"name":"Cashierest Affiliate Program Token","symbol":"cap","tickers":[{"base":"CAP","market":{"identifier":"allbit","name":"Allbit"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0x9A3f91237408ECB94e21E4c293010347F80a136F","description":"MKC stands for Medical link chain chain.The Medical link chain will usher in a new era in the application of block chain in the Medical field.

Difficulties in diversifying and managing investments.\n2. Issues with transparency and reputation.\n3.Problems with the mobility of cryptocurrency and assets across borders.\n\nWe propose three solutions to them:\n1. Cross platform loan aggregator with ratings and blockchain.\n2. Crypto P2P fund for global and cross-border participants.\n3. Portfolio management of loans across platforms in a single dashboard.\n\nWe believe that this toolbox of solutions is a win for all. The Crypto Community will gain unprecedented access to a decentralized and stable asset class. The large risk-averse institutional investors will get a method to trade the high volumes they seek. The retail investors will benefit of a large amount of assets formerly inaccessible to them.","id":"welltrado","links":{"announcement_url":["https://www.welltrado.com/blog/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3074709,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x9a0587eae7ef64b2b38a10442a44cfa43edd7d2a","https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a0587eae7ef64b2b38a10442a44cfa43edd7d2a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9a0587eae7ef64b2b38a10442a44cfa43edd7d2a"],"facebook_username":"Welltrado","homepage":["https://welltrado.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cryptodus/wtltokensale"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/welltrado/","telegram_channel_identifier":"welltrado","twitter_screen_name":"welltrado"},"name":"Welltrado","symbol":"wtl","tickers":[{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"WTL","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0x9a1bf361798Ef6538cCB8137EA900C4D4B48CA3D","description":"We want to build a future together with companies, creators, developers and individual users that combines the best parts of disruptive technologies like AI, blockchain, and AR/VR with the best human qualities.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the \u2018official\u2019 cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\n\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00f8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\n\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">BTC</a> blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.","id":"aurora","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4437272,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x9ab165d795019b6d8b3e971dda91071421305e5a","https://etherscan.io/token/0x9ab165d795019b6d8b3e971dda91071421305e5a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9ab165d795019b6d8b3e971dda91071421305e5a"],"chat_url":["https://auroraofficial.slack.com/"],"facebook_username":"AuroraOfficialEN","homepage":["https://www.aurorachain.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"AuroraOfficialEN","twitter_screen_name":"AuroraOffic_en"},"name":"Aurora","symbol":"aoa","tickers":[{"base":"AOA","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AOA","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AOA","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AOA","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x9b3E946E1a8ea0112b147aF4E6e020752F2446BC","description":"Puregold wants to create the first payment gateway based on blockchain technology, that uses Gold-Backed tokens.\n\nPuregold.sg was established in 2010 as an e-commerce store selling value-added gold and silver coins and bars.

This works similar to the how eBay functions by bidders placing their maximum bid on IP. For bids placed on ideas native to the platform Loci Nexus will analyze the value of the IP and reach out to the idea owner with the valuation at or below the maximum bid. For existing patents Loci Nexus will then reach out to the owner or agent on behalf of the bidder and connect the two parties if there is mutual interest. To be clear, Loci will not negotiate or broker bids for existing patents as Loci is not a patent agent.","id":"locicoin","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x9c23d67aea7b95d80942e3836bcdf7e708a747c2","https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c23d67aea7b95d80942e3836bcdf7e708a747c2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x9c23d67aea7b95d80942e3836bcdf7e708a747c2"],"homepage":["http://www.loci.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/loci_io/","twitter_screen_name":"Loci_io"},"name":"LOCIcoin","symbol":"loci","tickers":[{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"openledger","name":"OpenLedger DEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LOCI","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0x9d9223436dDD466FC247e9dbbD20207e640fEf58","description":"Olive is the world's 1st decentralized video live platform based on blockchain technology.In order to completely decentralize the live streaming ecosystem, Olive desirably introduces three new roles (transcoding users, streaming relay users, and channel hosts promoters) for advancing the progress of decentralization.

Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\n\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\n\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\n\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value.

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network\u2019s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it\u2019s a grand-slam idea.\n\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\n\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\n\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\n\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they\u2019re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\"","id":"pundi-x","links":{"announcement_url":["https://blog.pundix.com/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2212228,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xa15c7ebe1f07caf6bff097d8a589fb8ac49ae5b3","https://etherscan.io/token/0xa15c7ebe1f07caf6bff097d8a589fb8ac49ae5b3","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa15c7ebe1f07caf6bff097d8a589fb8ac49ae5b3"],"facebook_username":"pundixlabs","homepage":["https://pundix.com"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PundiX/","telegram_channel_identifier":"pundix","twitter_screen_name":"PundiXLabs"},"name":"Pundi

These assets are available in a global exchange whereby ownership can be transferred from person to person or institution to institution.\n\nGemVault is a new type of currency. Many national currencies of the world are no longer backed by anything but faith. There is no gold, silver, or other valuable commodity to anchor them to reality. Goods and services priced in these currencies are subject to inflation as the value of it deflates away through uncontrolled increase in the money supply.\n\nThe crypto-currencies offered by GemVault are tied directly to assets that have been valued and trusted for thousands of years. We make sending the value contained by gems as easy as sending an email. We combine the best of all worlds in this one-of-a-kind endeavor. No longer will the purchasing power of your 'transactionary' currency be eaten away by time. The value of fiat currencies always returns to their intrinsic value, zero. No longer will you be stifled by portability and fungibility problems presented by gold. Useful as it may be as a store of value, it is impractical for daily usage due to its' weight and difficulty to divide accurately into smaller quantities. And no longer will we face the issue of liquidity faced by gemstones. Lighter than gold but yet impossible to divide, we now offer a solution that has plagued humanity since the beginning of the recognition of gemstones as valuable and desirable.\n\nWhat we offer is simple. Whereas most crypto-currencies are backed by nothing and are mere copies, clones, or identical forked code of more famous ones, and yet others serve some sort of functional capacity, GemVault Coin also has a functional use while its' creations are backed by real assets. We will begin with GemVault Coin. GemVault Coin functions as a type of gate key to all of the other asset tokens offered by GemVault.

Since it\u2019s a Visa card, you can use your MCO Visa card just like you would any other card. The card and bank account are free for holders of cryptocurrency. In order to open an account, you simply sign up, verify your identity, and transfer any of the various accepted cryptocurrencies to your account. At this time, the Visa card is available to customers in Asia. They also have a waitlist for European customers. Customers in the United States does not have access to it at the moment. However, there are plans to change that. Solving the problem of everyday payments has the potential to be huge for cryptocurrency. However, MCO Visa card is not the only project attempting to create crypto-backed debit (or prepaid) cards. Other projects, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tenx\">TenX</a>, are working on the same issue. All of these projects run into challenges implementing such cards in a large scale, compliant manner. Crypto.com hopes to crack the code, ultimately getting cryptocurrencies and popular payment methods to play nicely together.\n\nCrypto.com was founded in June 2016 in Switzerland and rebranded from Monaco on 6th July 2018. Their first prototype was developed in October of that year. In February of 2017, they were accepted into a Hong Kong Government backed Cyberport incubation program, where they developed their platform until they were ready to launch their token sale in 2017. The sale closed in June with $26.7 million in funding. Their app became available to pre-registered users in August 2017, followed by the official partnership with Visa in October. The team consists of seasoned veterans in the fin-tech space, most of whom have experience in Asia, where Monaco Cards have first been made available.\n\nSince MCO Visa cards are backed by cryptocurrency, they don\u2019t have border issues like fiat currencies. As a result, you can use your card anywhere you go. The card will automatically default to the local fiat currency when you make a purchase. The low fees and exchange rates also apply in other countries. Transactions take place at the exact exchange rate that Crypto.com receives as an institutional trader. In contrast, when you use your debit card across borders with most banks, they\u2019ll add an additional percentage to the exchange rate or include a transaction fee. Crypto.com has connections with eight of the top ten international foreign exchange banks to facilitate currency conversion.\n\nThe MCO Visa card is a compelling option for anyone looking to make everyday purchases with cryptocurrency. It also makes sense for cross-border travelers. However, we can expect the rollout to take a long time and hit a lot of bumps along the way. The financial industry is highly regulated and cryptocurrency-backed payments is a complex issue, even if Crypto.com's solution seems to make it simple and user-friendly.","id":"monaco","links":{"announcement_url":["https://hk.linkedin.com/company/cryptocom","https://medium.com/@crypto.com"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1926269,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb63b606ac810a52cca15e44bb630fd42d8d1d83d","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb63b606ac810a52cca15e44bb630fd42d8d1d83d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb63b606ac810a52cca15e44bb630fd42d8d1d83d"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/B6cZahJ"],"facebook_username":"CryptoComOfficial","homepage":["https://www.crypto.com"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/","telegram_channel_identifier":"CryptoComOfficial","twitter_screen_name":"cryptocom"},"name":"Crypto.com","symbol":"mco","tickers":[{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coinnest","name":"CoinNest"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coinpark","name":"Coinpark"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"exx","name":"EXX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"exx","name":"EXX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MCO","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber

is an open-source platform that leverages the blockchain to provide end-to-end encrypted cloud storage services. Instead of maintaining its own data centres, Storj platform relies on a peer-to-peer network of individuals or entities sharing their storage spaces. The Storj project is owned and developed by Storj Labs Inc. Storj intends to facilitate a faster, cheaper, and secure file storage solution than traditional cloud storage platforms. To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.\n\nStorj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn. The company is headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. Shawn was previously appointed as CEO, but in March 2018, he stepped down from the post to serve as CSO of the company.\n\nShawn was replaced by Ben Golub (Ex-CEO of Docker) who currently serves as the Executive Chairman & Interim CEO. Co-founder John Quinn has been appointed as the Chief Revenue Officer. The company launched its initial coin offering (ICO) of the new tokens on May 19, 2017. At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.\n\nStorj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Up until now, cloud storage companies have dictated the terms of service to their users, and as a result, there has been little to no competition within this digital sector. However, with the introduction of Storj, all of that may change.\"\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/storj/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review on

It is a trading platform exclusively for cryptocurrencies. The name \"Binance\" is a combination of binary and finance.\n\nThus, the startup name shows that only cryptocurrencies can be traded against each other. It is not possible to trade crypto currencies against Fiat. The platform achieved an enormous success within a very short time and is focused on worldwide market with Malta headquarters. The cryptocurrency currently has a daily trading volume of 1.5 billion - 2 billion US dollars and is still increasing.\n\nIn total, there will only be 200 million BNBs. Binance uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/all?asset_platform_id=279\">ERC20 token standard</a> from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and has distributed it as follow: 50% sold on ICO, 40% to the team and 10% to Angel investors. The coin can be used to pay fees on Binance. These include trading fees, transaction fees, listing fees and others. Binance gives you a huge discount when fees are paid in BNB.\n\nThe schedule of BNB fees discount is as follow: In the first year, 50% discount on all fees, second year 25% discount, third year 12.5% discount, fourth year 6.75 % discount, and from the fifth year onwards there is no discount. This structure is used to incentivize users to buy BNB and do trades within Binance.\n\nBinance announced in a buyback plan that it would buy back up to 100 million BNB in Q1 2018. The coins are then burned. This means that they are devaluated to increase the value of the remaining coins. This benefits investors. In the future, the cryptocurrency will remain an asset on the trading platform and will be used as gas.\n\nOther tokens that are issued by exchanges include <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox Token</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/okb\">OKB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/huobi-token\">Huobi Token</a>, and more.","id":"binancecoin","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb8c77482e45f1f44de1745f52c74426c631bdd52","https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb8c77482e45f1f44de1745f52c74426c631bdd52","https://explorer.binance.org/"],"facebook_username":"binanceexchange","homepage":["https://www.binance.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs","https://github.com/binance-exchange/node-binance-api","https://github.com/binance-exchange/php-binance-api"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/binance","twitter_screen_name":"binance"},"name":"Binance Coin","symbol":"bnb","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xB91318F35Bdb262E9423Bc7c7c2A3A93DD93C92C","description":"Nuls (NULS) is a Singaporean based project is trying to develop a highly adaptable blockchain that can be used for enterprise solutions. They have regularly used the phrase \u201cNuls is nothing, Nuls is everything\u201d. In other words, Nuls is not traditionally defined and can be melded into anything that the community sees fit.\n\nNuls is looking to solve the problems faced by blockchains by creating one that features modularity and sub-chain operability. The two part design of functional modules and microkernels will provide both an underlying network mechanism and compartmentalized features for the blockchain.Essentially this should provide scalability and security to the blockchain, while adhering to the programming practices of low coupling and high cohesion. And because the blockchain is designed to be modular, it becomes hot pluggable, allowing for the addition or removal of modules at any time.\n\nThere are several blockchain problems inhibiting growth and development of the industry that have been identified by the Nuls team. One such issue is the cost of development. Because there is a shortage of blockchain proficient developers, those with skills can command higher salaries.This is simply demand exceeding supply and will eventually level out as more IT professionals learn blockchain skills. That\u2019s when businesses will see greater adoption of the technology, and only the most trustworthy blockchains will be of interest. Nuls is working to make trustworthy solutions to business problems.\n\nNuls is primarily focused on making blockchain more accessible for developers and businesses. It seeks to do this through its modularity and the use of sub-chains, and hopes to break the complexity associated with blockchain projects, while also solving the scalability issue that is hindering the growth of the industry. Nuls will make trust simpler, increasing the adoption rate of blockchain technology by businesses. They will also lower the cost of entry by removing complexity and increasing the supply of developers capable of programming blockchain applications. Taken all together, the Nuls ecosystem will benefit developers, businesses, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts by providing needed solutions and increasing usage and adoption of blockchain technology.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/nuls-coin/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review of Nuls.","id":"nuls","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2831034,"blockchain_site":["https://nuls.world/","https://nulscan.io/"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/uZ3QcxW"],"facebook_username":"nulscommunity","homepage":["https://nuls.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/nuls-io/nuls"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nulsservice/","telegram_channel_identifier":"Nulsio","twitter_screen_name":"Nuls"},"name":"Nuls","symbol":"nuls","tickers":[{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"NULS","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"INR"}]},{"address":"0xB97048628DB6B661D4C2aA833e95Dbe1A905B280","description":"TenX is a payment platform that facilitates digital and physical modes of transaction for cryptocurrencies to any merchant, even if they don\u2019t accept cryptocurrencies. Physical and digital modes of course, include bank accounts, wallets, debit cards, cash and much more. The primary agenda of the company is to make it easier and faster to use cryptocurrency and accelerate adoption for the industry. The TenX blockchain supports the PAY token, which is the fuel that runs the network and is the cryptocurrency using which transactions on the network are made.\n\nTenX came into existence in 2011 and was created by Toby Hoenisch. While at the university, he took a keen interest in cryptography though he believed that there was no success for cryptocurrencies.In 2012, Toby started trading Bitcoin when he got to know a member of bitcoin-community who was not able to open an account in bank and used TenX crypto currency instead. Toby Hoenisch and Michael Sperk started a one-bit start up in 2015 and introduced us to a debit card, through which payments with bitcoin could be done.\n\nCryptocurrency adoption is a longstanding problem - with most cryptocurrencies remaining relegated to the realms of hype and not seeing real-world usage, not as much as the enthusiasts would like, at least. This is an important problem being solved by the TenX coin, which seeks to make it easy for the end user to use cryptocurrencies by removing the hurdles associated with keeping different wallets and using them separately. As with all other investments, it is wise to do your own research, but seeing that TenX seems to be solving unique problems, it may certainly be worth a look.","id":"tenx","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1953612,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb97048628db6b661d4c2aa833e95dbe1a905b280","https://etherscan.io/token/0xB97048628DB6B661D4C2aA833e95Dbe1A905B280","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb97048628db6b661d4c2aa833e95dbe1a905b280"],"facebook_username":"tenxwallet","homepage":["https://www.tenx.tech/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/comit-network/RFCs","https://github.com/comit-network/comit-rs"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TenX","twitter_screen_name":"tenxwallet"},"name":"TenX","symbol":"pay","tickers":[{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"bitbay","name":"BitBay"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"buyucoin","name":"BuyUcoin"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"chainex","name":"ChainEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"CYB"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"oax","name":"OAX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"LMX"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"paroexchange","name":"Paro Exchange"},"target":"TUSD"},{"base":"PAY","market":{"identifier":"vebitcoin","name":"Vebitcoin"},"target":"TRY"}]},{"address":"0xB98d4C97425d9908E66E53A6fDf673ACcA0BE986","description":"The ArcBlock project was created to create the first Blockchain ecosystem in the world.

The platform revolves around the SWT token. One of the unique things about Swarm City is that the data is stored locally on your device. There\u2019s no central database. It\u2019s also an open source project. Swarm City was created by a development team from Antwerp and entrepreneurs from the United States. The project was initially launched as a decentralized world known as Arcade City. The whitepaper for Arcade City for appeared online in October 2016.\n\nSwarm City allows people to communicate and transact in a decentralized way. Like other blockchain platforms, Swarm City has no middleman or trusted, centralized platform. It\u2019s a P2P environment based on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the key features of Swarm City is the use of the Swarm City Token, or SWT. It\u2019s the unique of exchange in Swarm City. All transactions on Swarm City are sent using SWT. Like other decentralized platforms built on Ethereum, Swarm City needs to use its own token to power he blockchain. Once you have SWT, you can use tokens for every exchange. Users can choose to see a transaction in dollars, Euros, or SWT. However, SWT is always the actual vehicle for the transaction. All transactions are recorded onto the public ledger using SWT.\n\nSwarm City has several features such as offers. Any user can publish a request for services or goods as an offer. Whether it\u2019s ride-sharing or medical services, your offer can be posted to the Swarm City network. Besides, with Swarm City, funds are deposited into an escrow until the user releases the funds to the receiver. For every offer created, Swarm City automatically makes a smart contract. Both users deposit tokens into the smart contract as a guarantee for a successful transaction. In the event of a dispute, the user will not release the funds, and can start the process of resolving the dispute. There are also \u201cguilds\u201d that can resolve disputes based on their \u201cCharter of the Guild\u201d. Swarm City has a reputation system that works without the need to collect personal data. The platform makes a big deal out of the fact that it never has and never will collect or store personal data.","id":"swarm-city","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1794644,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb9e7f8568e08d5659f5d29c4997173d84cdf2607","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb9e7f8568e08d5659f5d29c4997173d84cdf2607","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb9e7f8568e08d5659f5d29c4997173d84cdf2607"],"facebook_username":"SwarmCityDApp","homepage":["https://swarm.city/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/swarmcity/SwarmCitySite"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SwarmCity","twitter_screen_name":"SwarmCityDApp"},"name":"Swarm City","symbol":"swt","tickers":[{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"coinbe","name":"Coinbe"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"SWT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xBA14b245d449965BdBeB630ebe135B569474F5b1","description":"Eva Cash (EVA) is an ECR20 based token which focus on building a network of users in the agricultural industry \u2013more specifically, aimed at introducing electronic (cryptocurrency) mode of payment in agricultural firms and industries globally.","id":"evacash","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5076975,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xba14b245d449965bdbeb630ebe135b569474f5b1","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xba14b245d449965bdbeb630ebe135b569474f5b1"],"homepage":["https://theevacash.com"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"evacash","twitter_screen_name":"evacash_token"},"name":"EvaCash","symbol":"evc","tickers":[{"base":"EVC","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"DOGE"}]},{"address":"0xBA3a79D758f19eFe588247388754b8e4d6EddA81","description":"VeriSafe will be the catalyst for projects, exchanges and communities to collaborate, creating an ecosystem where transparency, accountability, communication, and expertise go hand-in-hand to set a standard in the industry.","id":"verisafe","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@cpollo"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5069236,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xba3a79d758f19efe588247388754b8e4d6edda81"],"facebook_username":"verisafeprojectio","homepage":["https://www.verisafe.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/VeriSafe/Desktop-Wallet"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"cpollo2","twitter_screen_name":"VeriSafeProject"},"name":"VeriSafe","symbol":"vsf","tickers":[{"base":"VSF","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"VSF","market":{"identifier":"bleutrade","name":"bleutrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"VSF","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"VSF","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"VSF","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xBA50933C268F567BDC86E1aC131BE072C6B0b71a","description":"ARPA is a Secure Computation Network Compatible With Blockchains\n\nThey propose a blockchain-based secure computation network of Multi-party Computation (MPC).

Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\n\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials. With this technology, falsification of data can be kept at a minimum. Additionally, as you would expect from a blockchain-backed application, key information is safely stored and is accessible to everyone with 100% transparency.

According to Aeron's Whitepaper, \"The pilot\u2019s application is used by a pilot for personal flight logging. The company application collects and verifies data from aircraft operators, maintenance organizations, flight schools and fixed base operators\".\n\nAeron (ARN) is an ERC20 compliant <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> based token, with a fixed supply of 20,000,000 ARN. When the token was launched, a fixed amount of tokens were created and after which no more tokens are to be minted. About 60% of the supply is estimated to be in circulation. The supply should decrease over time when ARN tokens as taken out of circulation. Once Aeron receives ARN tokens in exchange of services, the coins will be again released in to the network.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Aeron plans to have a user base of 300000 by the end of 2020. This would encourage it to embed new features on its platform.\nWith the help of multi-app functionality and block technology, the company envisions to have an \u201cairline in the pocket\u201d of sorts within two years. While its price has fluctuated like most other cryptocurrencies, it delivered more than 15x returns within a short period between November 2017 to January 2018. As of July 2018, the price is nearly back to its November levels, at $0.57.","id":"aeron","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2078239,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xba5f11b16b155792cf3b2e6880e8706859a8aeb6","https://etherscan.io/token/0xBA5F11b16B155792Cf3B2E6880E8706859A8AEB6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xba5f11b16b155792cf3b2e6880e8706859a8aeb6"],"homepage":["https://aeron.aero/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/aeronaero/aeron"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/aeronaero","telegram_channel_identifier":"aeronaero","twitter_screen_name":"aeron_aero"},"name":"Aeron","symbol":"arn","tickers":[{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"allbit","name":"Allbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"chaince","name":"Chaince"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"exrates","name":"Exrates"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"kuna","name":"Kuna Exchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"mercatox","name":"Mercatox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"newdex","name":"Newdex"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"raisex","name":"Raisex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"raisex","name":"Raisex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"WAVES"},{"base":"ARN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xBA9ECaa4d6f22D3a69C41daA0584ac0e2418925e","description":"The activities of artists, investors, and consumers in the BTS PLAFORM will be transparently shared, and the distribution of revenue will be fairly based on blockchain.

It isn\u2019t a decentralized exchange.  Rather, it facilitates decentralized exchanging through ring-sharing and order matching. Decentralized and centralized exchanges alike will be able to implement Loopring, giving the exchanges access to cross blockchain and cross exchange liquidity and giving investors access to the best prices available on the broader market.  Moreover, Loopring is blockchain agnostic, meaning that any platform that uses smart contracts (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">NEO</a>, Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\">Qtum</a>) can integrate with Loopring.\n\nServing as its head, Loopring founder Daniel Wang used to run a centralized exchange called Coin Port back in 2014.  \u201cAt that time,\u201d he told Coin Central in an interview, \u201c[I was] trying to solve the problems of centralized exchanges, and then I realized that it\u2019s not possible.  Those problems are inherent to the centralized exchange model.\u201d  Thus, he began conceptualizing what would become Loopring.  In the past, he\u2019s also held a position as a Google Tech Lead and was a co-founder and VP of Yunrang Technology. Loopring\u2019s CMO, Jay Zhou, was formerly employed by Ernst and Young, helped found SJ Consulting, and used to work in PayPal\u2019s Risk Operations unit. Johnston Chen, the project\u2019s COO, has worked as the chief information officer at 3NOD.\n\nLoopring is not a DEX, but a modular protocol for building DEXs on multiple blockchains. We disassemble the component parts of a traditional exchange and offer a set of public smart contracts and decentralized actors in its place. The roles in the network include wallets, relays, liquidity-sharing consortium blockchains, order book browsers, Ring-Miners, and asset tokenization services. Before defining each, we should first understand Loopring orders. At its root, the Loopring protocol is a social protocol in the sense that it relies on coordination amongst members to operate effectively towards a goal. This is not dissimilar to cryptoeconomic protocols at large, and indeed, its usefulness is largely protected by the same mechanisms of coordination problems [20], grim trigger equilibrium, and bounded rationality.\n\nThe Loopring Protocol can facilitate trading between ERC20 tokens. Loopr needs to convert Ether to Ether Token for trading as Ether is not ERC20 compatible, but Ether Token is. Converting between Ether and Ether Token will be done for you automatically when you submit an order, but if you want to trade frequently, we strongly suggest you to convert some Ether to Ether Token beforehand manually; otherwise each order will take one more blockchain transaction just for the ETH-WETH conversion which takes time and gas. Conversions between ETH and WETH are done on-chain through Ethereum transactions. ETH and WETH are always converted 1:1 which is guaranteed by the WETH smart contract. The WETH smart contract also guarantees the total WETH issued is exactly the total ETH deposited. In other words, ETH and WETH is equiviate in value, and WETH is just the ERC20 form of ETH.\n\nThe Loopring blockchain project had managed to raise almost 15 million US dollars during the period of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/loopring\">Loopring ICO</a>, as all the regulatory experts watched this unprecedented crowdfunding. Daniel Wang, the founder and the main person behind the Loopring ICO, hand made it very transparent that the interface is quite bad but the underlying mechanism and the Order matching facility is very great. Loopring mining can be initiated very easily by using various performance calculating devices such as CPU, GPU, as well as application specific integrated circuits. The Loopring mining process can be initiated through the high-end Linux systems, according to reports. Loopring mining is basically a metaphor which is not similar to the Bitcoin mining but here the users need to match the specific orders from a huge database.  Specifically, Loopring mining requires the usage of the ethereum nodes along with JSON API, IPFS, etc.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/loopring-lrc/\">CoinBureau</a> for the

Melon is one such platform that works through a blockchain protocol allowing easy and efficient maintenance of cryptocurrencies. Acting as a hedge fund, Melon presents a fully customizable administration of your digital assets. You can use it as an online vault that allows you to store and transact your funds through its web portal. Melon was developed to meet the need for a cost-efficient and technologically advanced hedge fund to manage digital assets. Reto Trinkler and Mona El Isa founded the company, Melonport AG in July 2016.\n\nThe company created Melon as a digital asset management protocol. It is a first of its kind system that enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network. Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across multiple <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> networks to provide better efficiency and security for the assets. With the Melon protocol, users can save both time and money for investing in a hedge fund. Additionally, there is no requirement of a third party approval from a lawyer or advisor.\n\nMelon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/melon\">ICO</a> was launched in February 2017 and sold out within 10 minutes. Melonport is aiming to bridge the gap between the portfolio managers and the investors by removing the role of the third parties such as law firms. Melonport\u2019s CEO, Mona El Isa comes from a strong financial background and is versed with the problems of the investment industry.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to be done on the Melon project, even though things are looking quite positive already. An audit of the protocol has been completed already, and the project continues to advance. No further specifics have been provided on the website, although it remains to be seen what the future holds. Bringing more value to Melon Coin would be a good idea, yet it remains to be seen how that might be achieved.","id":"melon","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1763204,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xbeb9ef514a379b997e0798fdcc901ee474b6d9a1","https://etherscan.io/token/0xBEB9eF514a379B997e0798FDcC901Ee474B6D9A1","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbeb9ef514a379b997e0798fdcc901ee474b6d9a1"],"facebook_username":"melonport","homepage":["https://melonport.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/melonproject/protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melonproject","telegram_channel_identifier":"melonport","twitter_screen_name":"melonport"},"name":"Melon","symbol":"mln","tickers":[{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"bitsane","name":"Bitsane"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"everbloom","name":"Everbloom"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xBFD16E47a1B6AD4adBE7AB2A1Cb624C6c8B1bC3d","description":"With the mission of, \u201cConnecting the people of the world through cosplay,\u201d AMPLE! has aimed at providing a platform that would allow those who enjoy cosplaying to continue with their passion without having to leave anything behind.\n\nWe currently have users from over 70 countries throughout the world, who have uploaded more than 70 thousand pictures.\n\nMoving forward, AMPLE! will be carrying out fundraising via ICO in order to help evolve into a new platform with the introduction of its own encrypted currency, \u201cAMPLE!

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\n\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\n\nThe business logic of CyberVein\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\n\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine.\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\n\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price.\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\n\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\nThere\u2019s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept.

They then kicked off their public ICO on February 28, 2018 and by the end of the ICO on March 7, 2018, they had met their goal of $30,000,000 USD. Synthetix was <a href=\"https://blog.havven.io/havven-is-transforming-into-synthetix-2fdf727b8892\">rebranded</a> from Havven on November 30, 2018.\n\nSynthetix is led by a multidisciplinary team of 13 individuals. The project was founded by Kain Warwick, who previously co-founded blueshyft, one of the largest digital payment networks in Australia. The CTO is Justin Moses, who also serves as the Director of Engineering at MongoDB. Synthetix aims to address the problem that companies running centralized payment networks such as PayPal, credit card networks, or the SWIFT banking network have \u201cabsolute control over the value within the network, so any transaction conducted within them may be blocked or reversed at any time.\u201d According to the Synthetix white paper, \u201cAlthough this is ostensibly designed to protect users, it introduces systemic risk for all participants. If the network is compromised or its owners cease to behave benevolently, no party can trust that the value in their account is secure or accessible.\u201d\n\nThis is theorized to work because anyone who holds SNX tokens in escrow will be incentivized by Synthetix rewards derived from network transaction fees that will be distributed \u201cin proportion with how well each issuer maintains the correct Synths supply.\u201d When a Synthetix escrow user puts their SNX in escrow, USD-stabilized Synths will be automatically put up for sale on a decentralized exchange at a price of $1 USD. To release escrowed SNX, the user must buy back the Synths issued (also at a price of $1 USD) at which point the Synths will be burned. The Synthetix system uses an algorithm to adjust network fees, and therefore dividends, to SNX holders to incentivize (or disincentivize) the holding of SNX in escrow smart contracts, and thus, the creation of Synths. The theory is that this will cause users to mint and burn Synths in the appropriate amount based solely on supply and demand.","id":"havven","links":{"announcement_url":["https://blog.synthetix.io/","https://t.me/havven_news"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xc011a72400e58ecd99ee497cf89e3775d4bd732f","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a72400e58ecd99ee497cf89e3775d4bd732f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc011a72400e58ecd99ee497cf89e3775d4bd732f"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/AEdUHzt"],"facebook_username":"havven.io","homepage":["https://www.synthetix.io/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.havven.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix","https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-js"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/","telegram_channel_identifier":"havven_official1","twitter_screen_name":"synthetix_io"},"name":"Synthetix Network Token","symbol":"snx","tickers":[{"base":"SNX","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"SNX","market":{"identifier":"kucoin","name":"KuCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HAV","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"SNX","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2","description":"W-ETH is \"wrapped ETH\" but let's start by introducing the players.

Quadrant aims to provide a blueprint for mapping disparate data sources. It will support proof of data authenticity and provenance via data stamping, the creation of \u201cConstellations\u201d (data smart contracts) for disparate data sources, and fair remuneration and incentive sharing. Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, \u201cNurseries\u201d (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and \u201cPioneers\u201d (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations. This new transparent ecosystem ensures that companies get the authentic data they need.\n\nWhere Quadrant has major potential for impact is the ability it provides \u201cElons\u201d (the brightest data minds) to find linkages between different constellations and, in turn, create mega Constellations that can be used by Data Consumers to solve real-world problems. This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\n\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\n\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE). It may be converted into QUAD via a gateway when the Quadrant mainnet is launched.","id":"quadrant-protocol","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/quadrantprotocol","https://www.linkedin.com/company/quadrantprotocol/"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xc28e931814725bbeb9e670676fabbcb694fe7df2","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc28e931814725bbeb9e670676fabbcb694fe7df2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc28e931814725bbeb9e670676fabbcb694fe7df2"],"facebook_username":"quadrantprotocol","homepage":["https://www.quadrantprotocol.com/#"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/quadrantprotocol/","telegram_channel_identifier":"quadrantprotocol","twitter_screen_name":"explorequadrant"},"name":"Quadrant Protocol","symbol":"equad","tickers":[{"base":"EQUAD","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"EQUAD","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"EQUAD","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xC2bE193f581F129Ace32d2Fe949d100Dc09C2A05","description":"UTD is the world's first application ecology based on TOKEN economy model.

Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of \u201con-demand\u201d services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides.\n\nTwo different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power, which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.\n\n\u25cf The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users \u2013 where customers create reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit\u2019s incentive model.\n\n\u25cf The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system, Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized.\n\n\u25cf In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user\u2019s viewing space, (ii) the right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information.\n\nAs such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry\u2019s ecosystem by redistributing ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.","id":"cosmo-coin","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@Cosmochain"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xc4bcd64cb216d49fd3c643a32762f34626b45a1a","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc4bcd64cb216d49fd3c643a32762f34626b45a1a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc4bcd64cb216d49fd3c643a32762f34626b45a1a"],"facebook_username":"cosmochain","homepage":["https://cosmochain.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cosmochain/CosmoCoin"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"cosmochain_english","twitter_screen_name":"cosmochain"},"name":"Cosmo Coin","symbol":"cosm","tickers":[{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinall","name":"CoinAll"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xC50948bac01116F246259070Ea6084C04649efDF","description":"By utilizing the Blockchain technology, Pindify is providing the perfect solution for artists digital rights / ownership and management.

Instead, the Nectar token will act as a loyalty token. The NEC is designed to maintain liquidity and market efficiency through the incentivisation of platform loyalty. Users who choose to register for the scheme and take on the role of market maker on the Ethfinex platform, or using integrated decentralised exchange protocols, will automatically generate NEC\u2019s, as a loyalty reward, and subsequently earn a stake in the future development, governance and success of the platform. NEC will adhere to the ERC20 Token Standard to ensure cross-compatibility with alternate exchange protocols interfacing with Ethfinex. This allows other protocols and exchanges to reward users for the liquidity they contribute.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of the Nectar token is to reward market makers for the value they create, in turn encouraging them to maintain market thickness and minimised spreads on the platform trading pairs. Loyalty points entitle holders to loyalty rewards held in the Liquidity Token Smart Contract, which can be redeemed (in part or in whole) through the Redeem Mechanism upon request. Loyalty points can be traded on a secondary market amongst white listed Ethfinex users. If no tokens are redeemed at the end of a 28 day cycle, the total supply of NEC will grow. Ethfinex will hold an initial supply of NEC which will not grow over time\u200a\u2014\u200aas a result, the percentage ownership will gradually decrease as new tokens are issued and redeemed.\n\nThe exact governance mechanism will be particularly important in ensuring the details and implementation of the token can be refined in time for the Ethfinex launch. Defining the perfect liquidity incentive mechanism will be impossible without continuous testing and feedback in real markets, and the governance will complete the loop in allowing improvements to take place. Following community feedback, we have decided against the internal redesign of the chosen governance mechanism; instead, we will look to adopt the industry best practise. There are a number of fantastic projects in the space who are currently working on this, such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon\">Aragon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x\">District0x</a>, some of whom we are in contact with, and we are eager to refine our governance model in accordance with them.\n\nEthfinex has come out with a smart solution and is not organizing a direct ICO but I see it as an indirect one with a long-term range into the future where decentralized exchanges will be the future or crypto-economy. Ethfinex\u2019s and Nectar\u2019s token development will bring all the ERC20 tokens under one platform dedicated to Ethereum token economy which in itself will be a huge thing. The total initial supply of NEC is 1 billion tokens out which the current circulating supply is 500,000,000 NEC. This supply will be distributed to the team and early adopters as loyalty points and this will also keep growing every 30 days, with new tokens being created based on market maker programme.","id":"nectar-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://www.ethfinex.com/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2824735,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xcc80c051057b774cd75067dc48f8987c4eb97a5e","https://etherscan.io/token/0xcc80c051057b774cd75067dc48f8987c4eb97a5e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xcc80c051057b774cd75067dc48f8987c4eb97a5e"],"facebook_username":"ethfinex","homepage":["https://nectar.community/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.ethfinex.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ethfinex/nectar"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinex/","telegram_channel_identifier":"ethfinextelegram","twitter_screen_name":"ethfinex"},"name":"Nectar Token","symbol":"nec","tickers":[{"base":"NEC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"NEC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xCd64aA18dDbCe84411aDBfe6da49354ba5187a45","description":"Korbot (KBOT) is an utility token used at Korbot Platform, an algorithmic trading platform built for global cryptocurrency investors.","id":"korbot-platform","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/korbotplatform"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd64aa18ddbce84411adbfe6da49354ba5187a45"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/korbotplatformannouncement"],"facebook_username":"korbotplatform","homepage":["https://www.korbot.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"korbot_platform","twitter_screen_name":"korbotplatform"},"name":"Korbot","symbol":"kbot","tickers":[{"base":"KBOT","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xCdCFc0f66c522Fd086A1b725ea3c0Eeb9F9e8814","description":"Aurora is a collection of Ethereum applications and protocols that together form a decentralized banking and finance platform.

FUSION was established by the CEO of BitSE, an incubation company which developed <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\">QTUM Blockchain</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vechain\">VeChain</a> blockchain, crypto projects which are both successful. Fusion uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM) that borrows things from PoW and PoS. At the same time, it uses a parallel computing by grouping nodes together, creating an efficient and safe platform.\n\nThe Fusion team used in its whitepaper the term Internet of Values which refers mostly to cryptocurrency related matters, such as the exchange and management of digital assets securely and without intermediaries. The Distributed Control Right Management is a security layer that protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures that no one can have access the complete private key, meaning that no single node can gain control of the digital assets. Along with the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION incorporated time and event based triggers into its smart contracts. These three triggering modes have resulted from various financial situations, and have been designed to meet the requests of complex financial smart contracts.\n\nBitSE, the company behind the Fusion Project, was founded in 2013 by Dejun Qian, being also responsible for the creation of QTUM and VeChain. QTUM and VeChain are both blockchain foundations which developed into independent ventures. The native token of the Fusion platform, FSN, will be used in paying network fees. Smart contracts require FSN in order for them to be executed, much like how ETH is used in the Ethereum network. Fusion (FSN) has a short history in the cryptocurrency market, which does not allow us to make predictions in the long term. Fusion cryptocurrency will have its Fusion mainnet launch before 30th June.

CEO, and co-founder, Simon Yu, evolved this digital currency from an app called BitMaker, he and co-founder, Calvin Hsieh, worked on in 2014. BitMaker allowed users to send money without transaction fees which was the main reason this app experienced high growth volumes. A new feature called BitTask was introduced which allowed users to trade their time and effort for trying out new products in exchange for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or Ethereum. This feature is now the STORM Play App and has experienced massive growth since its launch in Feb 2017.\n\nThe vision the founders have for STORM is beyond just an ordinary Cryptocurrency. They aim to create a marketplace for decentralized marketplace for tasks which will be called the \u201cStorm Market\u201d. \u201cThe Storm Market will operate similar to the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store in that it will serve as a platform where Storm Makers and Storm Players can create and accept tasks using smart contracts powered and paid for with STORM tokens.\u201d The team is confident of the success of the app as it strongly relies on the give and takes model. By completing relatively easy and enjoyable tasks, users can potentially earn quite a bit of STORM, Ethereum or even Bitcoin.\n\nStorm Market is targeting the freelancing industry around micro-tasks. Currently, there are identified competitors in the market like Upwork, Mechanical Turk, etc. which are circulating huge amount of money through their platform with existing inefficiencies that ultimately creates hurdles for the freelancers. They deduct huge amount from their users earning by charging 40% of transaction cost.  The Storm market is striving to resolve the problems by providing following benefits, such as as compared to traditional micro-task marketplaces, they will charge reduce transaction fees. Besides, they Eliminate the interruption of any middlemen between buyers and sellers.\n\nStorm Market is a gamified micro-task marketplace that enables users to earn by completing different tasks. The company is expanding its platform by creating decentralized storm market by incorporating blockchain technology. In storm market, people can use their skills and talents to accomplish various tasks and get good rewards for it in the form of tokens. In short, a company is aiming to operate decentralized platform where anyone can offer or engage in tasks by utilizing blockchain based smart contracts supported by tokens (ERC-20).\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/storm-token/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of Storm Token.","id":"storm","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2006999,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd0a4b8946cb52f0661273bfbc6fd0e0c75fc6433","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd0a4b8946cb52f0661273bfbc6fd0e0c75fc6433","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd0a4b8946cb52f0661273bfbc6fd0e0c75fc6433"],"facebook_username":"stormtoken","homepage":["https://stormtoken.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/StormX-Inc/crowdsale"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stormtoken","twitter_screen_name":"Storm_Token"},"name":"Storm","symbol":"storm","tickers":[{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"bancor","name":"Bancor Network"},"target":"BNT"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"coinplace","name":"Coinplace"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"ethex","name":"Ethex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"STORM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xD110bB8a24B100c37aF7310416E685af807C1F10","description":"WDT is a completely decentralized encrypted money payment ecosystem.

Through this platform, the Cosmochain Team aims to solve the aforementioned unmet needs of both companies and customers. All data collected from platform participants are kept confidential in this customer-centered ecosystem. Those who contribute their scarce time and attention toward producing and curating contents for others are compensated with tokens and receive pro-rata ownership of the contents they create. On the other hand, cosmetics product suppliers are able to actualize a wide variety of \u201con-demand\u201d services on the platform by utilizing API that Cosmochain provides.\n\nTwo different tokens and one internal virtual index make up the Cosmochain ecosystem: 1) The first token is an externally traded token called Cosmo Coin, 2) The second token as well as an index of contribution to the platform is Cosmo Power, which can be used to make payment within the platform and given out as rewards for activities, and 3) The one virtual index is called Cosmo Level. Cosmo Level, a reputation index, is designed to prevent abuse of power within the platform and can only be accumulated by actual activities and contribution. Having been assigned distinct roles within the Cosmochain platform, these three entities construct a healthy ecosystem.\n\n\u25cf The success of the Cosmochain platform lies in the active participation of users \u2013 where customers create reliable data after trying out various cosmetics products and sharing the experience with one another on the platform. As a result, Cosmochain has designed its own transparent and fair reward system based on Steemit\u2019s incentive model.\n\n\u25cf The Cosmochain platform connects this user-created data to interested company participants and distributes the payment made by the company to customers as reward for use of the information. Through this reward system, Cosmochain aims to address two structural issues of social media-based platforms: 1) risk of inflation following the necessity of a long-term and great quantity of token issuance to grow the community, and 2) risk of decreasing attractiveness of contribution rewards after the inflation rate has been stabilized.\n\n\u25cf In addition, the Cosmochain platform aims to realize an upgraded tokenization model that brings the power back to its users by redistributing the following: (i) the right to display ads in a user\u2019s viewing space, (ii) the right to access a personally curated Marketplace, and (iii) the right to share personal data to partake in a study or survey. Simply speaking, the Cosmochain platform will go beyond simply allowing users to share onedimensional personal information.\n\nAs such, Cosmochain serves the purpose of revolutionizing the cosmetics industry\u2019s ecosystem by redistributing ownership and management authority of personal cosmetics data and contents to those in need, and through operations of transparent rewarding system for the redistribution of data.","id":"cosmo-coin","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@Cosmochain"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd1e10c37a27d95d95720291b1dc6f12f74c71443","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd1e10c37a27d95d95720291b1dc6f12f74c71443","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd1e10c37a27d95d95720291b1dc6f12f74c71443"],"facebook_username":"cosmochain","homepage":["https://cosmochain.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cosmochain/CosmoCoin"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"cosmochain_english","twitter_screen_name":"cosmochain"},"name":"Cosmo Coin","symbol":"cosm","tickers":[{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinall","name":"CoinAll"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"COSM","market":{"identifier":"uex","name":"UEX"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xD1c10d433C888E6d1841fF924d0CE45157f0d5Cd","description":"FAST GLOBAL BORDERLESS CURRENCIES\nPowered by the Ethereum Classic Blockchain\n\u200b\nScarce Digital Assets & Intercontinental Currencies","id":"bitunits","links":{"blockchain_site":["http://etherhub.io/addr/0xd1c10d433c888e6d1841ff924d0ce45157f0d5cd#tab_addr_3"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/QRAs4qu"],"homepage":["https://www.bitunits.club/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BitUnits/","twitter_screen_name":"bitunits"},"name":"BitUnits","symbol":"units","tickers":[{"base":"UNITS","market":{"identifier":"saturn_network","name":"Saturn Network"},"target":"ETC"}]},{"address":"0xD28807D7eF028AF6728d12Ccd621b2242Da2a64f","description":"The first ETHICAL cryptocurrency for TRANSPARENT financial flows for NGO's\u200b. \u200bWhat Ripple is for the banks, is GMX for the Non-Governmental Organisations\u200b. \u200bGMX will provide a Trusted Blockchain Directory (TBD) in which NGO's can set up the wallet address of every partner they work with.

BINGO has been recommended by many experts in the blockchain industry, including but not limited to: PATRICK DAI (SHUAI CHU) - Co-Founder of QTUM; Dr. Ma Zhao F. - Postdoctor of Tsinghua University, IEEE Member, ACM member, the lead of the blockchain technology team in Beijing, China. As the technology consultant for BINGO, Mob Arts is invested by China\u2019s IT industry giant TENCENT and has the million-dollar experience in APP developing and publishing, NEXON has been authorized to publish one of their star products and received huge success. What\u2019s more, BINGO also developed the first Crypto-currency game with specific game play QTUM HEROES together with QTUM, and thus starts their deep cooperation era.\n\nBiNGO is the first pan-entertainment platform to operate on a blockchain. It applies decentralization principles to heavy user aggregation and gameplayer communications, creating a new generation of entertainment platforms. The project is composed of a Customer Management System, the BiNGO Wallet, a Traffic Exchange System, a Decentralized Data Analysis System, and the BiNGO Foundation.\n\nThe success of the BiNGO Platform will be dependent on offering users a wide range of world-class games and entertainment. MobArts, as technical partner and an award-winning game publisher, has a history of releasing top-tier games that have been downloaded more than a hundred million of times and consistently ranked in the top 10 on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store.\n\nBingo is essentially a game store, much like the App Store or Google Play. However, instead of using traditional currencies, it uses a coin native to the Bingo ecosystem called 777 that can be securely stored in, or traded between, Bingo wallets. All that is needed for game development, publishing, or for making game payments are the Bingo platform and the Bingo wallet.BINGO promises to offer game publishers and developers low barriers to entry, fair and fast access to a wide market of players, and the ability to quickly and easily monetize their offerings. In addition to all of the above, the Bingo ecosystem is working to combine social, advertising, analytics, and other modules to offer all users a truly comprehensive, pan-entertainment system that caters to all their needs.\n\nThis specific market segment is one that is expected to grow substantially in the years to come. With blockchain technologies promising to bring about a revolution in the way we do everything, Bingo, with a talented tech team behind it and a game industry visionary at the helm, is poised to completely redefine online games.","id":"777-bingo","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/777bingo"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3069984,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd8002cd05d5b2a85557e1caaa179cc2408d5ad42","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd8002cd05d5b2a85557e1caaa179cc2408d5ad42","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd8002cd05d5b2a85557e1caaa179cc2408d5ad42"],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/gqEhL5G","https://open.kakao.com/o/gveiWlM"],"facebook_username":"777BingoPlatform","homepage":["https://www.bingo.fun/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"bingo777","twitter_screen_name":"Bingo_Platform"},"name":"777.Bingo","symbol":"777","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xD8698a985B89650d0A70f99AD2909bD0c0b4b51c","description":"Consentium is a best-in-class chat application with multi-digital-currency C2C (consumer to consumer) transfers as well as proprietary chat community monetisation model (CCM).","id":"consentium","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@consentium"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2848892,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd8698a985b89650d0a70f99ad2909bd0c0b4b51c","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd8698a985b89650d0a70f99ad2909bd0c0b4b51c"],"facebook_username":"consentium","homepage":["https://consentium.net/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"consentiumofficial","twitter_screen_name":"ConsentiumCoin"},"name":"Consentium","symbol":"csm","tickers":[{"base":"CSM","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CSM","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xD89040Ac9823B72F64d71f66Fa2DeAE7C8520671","description":"NewSolution is a currency designed for medium- to long-term investors, our purpose is to make a sustainable and stable currency to be used in your day to day, without distribution of currencies through the network investors will have their funds converted into NST, being able to have incomes with the small market oscillation.70% of all NST deals will be geared toward the trade market, causing their price to rise steadily.","id":"newsolution","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5100959,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd89040ac9823b72f64d71f66fa2deae7c8520671"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/GQNkHY"],"facebook_username":"NewSolutionCoin","homepage":["https://newsolutioncoin.com"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Newsolutioncoin/NewSolution"]},"twitter_screen_name":"NewSolutionCoin"},"name":"Newsolution","symbol":"nst","tickers":[{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"NST","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0xD8912C10681D8B21Fd3742244f44658dBA12264E","description":"Plutons are digital tokens issued to users on the Ethereum blockchain, these are native to the Plutus app. To provide an analogy, these tokens are similar to cash back or frequent flier miles.

A single medium of exchange in the form of Mainframe tokens (MFT) is also used to improve the developer and user experience.

Digix has two cryptocurrencies, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digix-gold\">Digix Gold (DGX)</a> and DigixDAO (DGD), each of which serves a key role in the structure.  The company proudly gets 99.99 percent of its gold from LBMA-approved refiners, with zero percent from fractional reserves, delivering confidence. With Digix, investors can take advantage of the stability and value of gold as well as the ease of cryptocurrency. Digix essentially tokenizes gold within Ethereum. It takes advantage of the Distributed Ledger\u2019s immutability, auditability, and transparency, applying all these benefits to the precious physical asset of gold. Additionally, Digix has developed multiple technologies, such as the DGX tokens and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/digixdao-introduces-gold-tokens-ethereum\">introduced a new Proof of Asset protocol</a> (POA).\n\nA key feature of Digix is its physical gold bullion. By investing, users buy bullion from the LBMA refineries, including the Assay Certificates from refiners like Nadir Bullion, PAMP Suisse, Valcambi, and others. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. Every quarter, it audits each gold asset within the safehouse vaults. This auditor has been in business since 1828 and is a world leader in certification, inspection, and testing services. With such a long track record, investors should be able to trust Bureau Veritas for their auditing services. Finally, Digix involves recast, which means customers can take their DGX delivery at the partnering custodial vault.\n\nDigix incorporated in Singapore in December 2014 and the DGD crowdsale took place on March 30th, 2016. It was the first ever crowdsale and major Distributed Autonomous Organization hosted on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The sale intended to run for 30 days but met its 5.5 million dollars hard cap in just 12 hours, selling 1.7 million DGD tokens and reserving 300,000 for the Digix team. Pledges who sent over 15,000 USD worth of Ether received a special badge which will allow them to submit proposals to the DigixDAO. For better or worse, when you see the word DAO, you might think of hacking. In July 2017, over 4000 DGD were indeed stolen due to a vulnerability in the crowdsale smart contract. The bug was eventually fixed and the tokens reimbursed to the 35 affected addresses.\n\nIn January 2018, the vast majority of the cryptocurrency market crashed. DGD was the only coin in the top 100 to rise in value in that time. Perhaps this is an early indicator that people will seek gold as a safe haven during times of market uncertainty. The ICO price of DGD was about 3 dollars, but in 2018, DGD reached an all-time high of over 400 dollars. When Digix finally delivers the DGX tokens and the rewards to DGD participants start rolling in, we might see an even higher demand for DigixDAO.

Such transformations are challenges to the industry's deep-rooted problems brought about by new technologies and ideas. New technologies make it possible to turn ideas into reality, and ideas have long been guiding the direction of technological development. The ideas include decentralization and populism, which represent people's demands for the return of certain rights and a more equitable, flattened world. The technologies include blockchains, artificial intelligence (AI), and the internet of things (IoT), none of which work independently. These technologies need to work together to allow for industrial applications and business work-flows to be restructured and reach new horizons.\n\nIn response to these changes and trends, ABO, based on its in-depth research and analysis in the medical care industry, plans to bring about the return of medical data ownership and management rights by taking advantage of distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, ABO will promote the credibility and inter-operability of medical devices and enhance the st andardization of medical data. In this way, a secure, highly efficient, and cross-system data sharing system will be created. Finally, a credible environment will be established for services related to the use of medical data, including  data acquisition, annotation, storage, transmission, computation, and other services utilizing AI.\n\nABO positioning: Medical data sharing and AI protocols platform.\n\nABO objectives: Setting up a healthier blockchain medical ecosphere and offering a better medical service.","id":"abo","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xe1fd7cb1a330c48cc0a09d31f0786b61bfc43f71","https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1fd7cb1a330c48cc0a09d31f0786b61bfc43f71","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe1fd7cb1a330c48cc0a09d31f0786b61bfc43f71"],"facebook_username":"abo.hello.98","homepage":["http://www.abochain.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"ABOChain","twitter_screen_name":"HelloABOs"},"name":"ABO","symbol":"abo","tickers":[{"base":"ABO","market":{"identifier":"exx","name":"EXX"},"target":"CNYT"},{"base":"ABO","market":{"identifier":"exx","name":"EXX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ABO","market":{"identifier":"zg","name":"ZG.com"},"target":"CNZ"}]},{"address":"0xE235B2A194C9cbf8e32167C398D929a6057877d8","description":"AMeiToken is a new gaming community based on the CIS economy.

The new paradigm provided by blockchain technology is ideal for online advertising, for it enables companies to better analyze the data collected from web users. This gives them the opportunity to precisely target audiences on a large scale at a much lower cost compared to traditional marketing tools.\n\nThe Bitcomo affiliate marketing CPA network is wholly performance-based. This means that advertisers pay only when they see results and internet marketers are rewarded for each visitor or customer acquired through their own marketing efforts. This method incentivizes and rewards publishers and advertisers alike.\n\nOur goal is to create an affiliate marketing network which is completely impervious to ad fraud and payout problems. Bitcomo's business model is anchored by blockchain technology and the immutable proof and transparency this provides. This ensures the security of each user's data, whilst simplifying the interactions between them. Blockchain also eliminates unnecessary intermediaries between a company and its target audience.

The team behind 0x strongly believes that in the future, you will find thousands of tokens from Ethereum and that 0x can provide an efficient and trustworthy way to exchange them.\n\n0x have several benefits such as it can be any asset. The 0x protocol facilitates the exchange of a growing number of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum-based tokens</a> including currencies, game items, and many more digital assets. Besides, it has a networked liquidity. By sharing a standard API, relayers can easily aggregate liquidity pools, creating network effects around liquidity that compound as more relayers come online. 0x also can be exchanged anywhere. 0x allows trade functionality to fade into the background, enabling developers to focus on building while 0x handles the exchange.\n\nThe co-founders of 0x are Will Warren and Amir Bandeali, the first of which is the CEO and the second of which is the CTO. Both are in smart contract research and development. Warren used to conduct applied physics research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory after studying mechanical engineering at UC San Diego. Bandeali used to be a fixed income trader with DRW after he studied finance at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.\n\n0x doesn\u2019t charge fees of any type to use their protocol; it is free. However, if someone chooses to create a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange using the protocol, that person, known as a Relayer, can charge fees.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n0x protocol works where : A \u201cCreator\u201d sends his request and at that same point the request is posted in an off-chain arrange/order book by the \u201cRelayer\u201d, next to which the request is acknowledged by the \u201cTaker\u201d by pushing the exchange into the task\u2019s DEX smart contract. Thus, the 0x protocol uses off-chain order books, which is maintained by a relayer for settlement of trade between two parties. Relayers, being behind the maintenance and creation of these channels are incentivised by charging and collecting fees.\n\n0x (ZRX) Token:\n\nZRX token is the unique aspect of 0x project which will be used to pay \u2018relayers the trading fees by the users of the protocol. It is also a governance token in a decentralized form for the 0x protocol\u2019s upgrade.","id":"0x","links":{"announcement_url":["https://blog.0xproject.com/latest"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498"],"homepage":["https://0x.org/"],"official_forum_url":["https://forum.0xproject.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit","https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo","https://github.com/0xProject/0x-starter-project","https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/0xProject","twitter_screen_name":"0xproject"},"name":"0x","symbol":"zrx","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xE42Ba5558b00d2E6109CC60412d5D4c9473FE998","description":"An ERC20 Token built on top of Ethereum Blockchain which aims to provide solution for Online Business Education leveraging Blockchain Technology.","id":"imm-coin","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4546973,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe42ba5558b00d2e6109cc60412d5d4c9473fe998","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xe42ba5558b00d2e6109cc60412d5d4c9473fe998"],"homepage":["https://immcoin.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/immcoin/immcoin.io"]},"twitter_screen_name":"immtradersclub"},"name":"IMM COIN","symbol":"imc","tickers":[{"base":"IMC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IMC","market":{"identifier":"thetokenstore","name":"Token.Store"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xE477292f1B3268687A29376116B0ED27A9c76170","description":"HERO radically changes todays centralized way of online betting.

One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.\n\nQuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network\u2019s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain\u2019s decentralized nature.\n\nQuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards\u2019 blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.\n\nQuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.\n\nThe main features of Quarkchain are:\n\n1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\n\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\n\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\n\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\n\n5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet.","id":"quark-chain","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@quarkchainquark","https://steemit.com/@quarkchain"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xea26c4ac16d4a5a106820bc8aee85fd0b7b2b664","https://etherscan.io/token/0xea26c4ac16d4a5a106820bc8aee85fd0b7b2b664","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xea26c4ac16d4a5a106820bc8aee85fd0b7b2b664"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/QuarkChain_News"],"facebook_username":"quarkchain","homepage":["https://quarkchain.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain","https://github.com/QuarkChain/quarkchain-web3.js"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/quarkchainio/","telegram_channel_identifier":"quarkchainio","twitter_screen_name":"Quark_Chain"},"name":"QuarkChain","symbol":"qkc","tickers":[{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"bitasset","name":"BitAsset"},"target":"CNYT"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"bitasset","name":"BitAsset"},"target":"TWD"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"EOS"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"coinpark","name":"Coinpark"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"XRP"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"QKC","market":{"identifier":"wazirx","name":"WazirX"},"target":"INR"}]},{"address":"0xEA38eAa3C86c8F9B751533Ba2E562deb9acDED40","description":"The Power of Ethereum in the Palm of your Hand.

Institutions leverage this data to increase their competitive edge in the market. SHP reserves a stake in the Sharpe tokenized economy, and payments to users for predictions depend on their stake. This enforces a degree of scarcity in our ecosystem, and further incentivises users to provide the best predictions they can.\n\nSharpe Capital has developed a proprietary, automated quantitative trading algorithm driven by a hybrid machine learning and artificial intelligence model, bringing together microeconomic fundamentals, macroeconomic data, real-time world events, crowd-sourced market sentiment and NLP-driven linguistic analysis, into an overarching model capable of managing a robust, high alpha portfolio across various asset classes. Sharpe Capital will operate a proprietary investment fund operating much like an automated enhanced index fund to further generate revenue to support the SHP community economy.\n\nThe Sharpe Financial Markets Protocol aims to describe a new gold standard for hedge fund management, leveraging blockchain technology to provide a low barrier to entry, continuous liquidity, anti-corruption protections, international access and optimal risk-adjusted returns. Our longer term goal, therefore, is to develop the Sharpe Crypto-Derivative (SCD) token, subject to necessary approvals. This first-inclass token creates the foundations for a solid link between blockchain assets and the global economy, and will ultimately provide possible payment of dividends to participants. Through our community governance structure, in which SHP holders have the right to table and vote on motions which guide the direction of Sharpe Capital, we ultimately aim to deliver a suite of investment products with various risk profiles and across multiple asset classes, including blockchain assets. The timeline for SCD issuance is Q1 2019. An independent crowd-sale will be held for the issuance of SCD tokens, from which 100% of the proceeds will be directly invested using our proprietary trading technology.\n\nSharpe Capital is realizing similar ambitions with its own coin offering, raising money to support a new kind of fund that runs on market fundamentals and crowdsourced sentiment as well.

It isn\u2019t a decentralized exchange.  Rather, it facilitates decentralized exchanging through ring-sharing and order matching. Decentralized and centralized exchanges alike will be able to implement Loopring, giving the exchanges access to cross blockchain and cross exchange liquidity and giving investors access to the best prices available on the broader market.  Moreover, Loopring is blockchain agnostic, meaning that any platform that uses smart contracts (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/neo\">NEO</a>, Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qtum\">Qtum</a>) can integrate with Loopring.\n\nServing as its head, Loopring founder Daniel Wang used to run a centralized exchange called Coin Port back in 2014.  \u201cAt that time,\u201d he told Coin Central in an interview, \u201c[I was] trying to solve the problems of centralized exchanges, and then I realized that it\u2019s not possible.  Those problems are inherent to the centralized exchange model.\u201d  Thus, he began conceptualizing what would become Loopring.  In the past, he\u2019s also held a position as a Google Tech Lead and was a co-founder and VP of Yunrang Technology. Loopring\u2019s CMO, Jay Zhou, was formerly employed by Ernst and Young, helped found SJ Consulting, and used to work in PayPal\u2019s Risk Operations unit. Johnston Chen, the project\u2019s COO, has worked as the chief information officer at 3NOD.\n\nLoopring is not a DEX, but a modular protocol for building DEXs on multiple blockchains. We disassemble the component parts of a traditional exchange and offer a set of public smart contracts and decentralized actors in its place. The roles in the network include wallets, relays, liquidity-sharing consortium blockchains, order book browsers, Ring-Miners, and asset tokenization services. Before defining each, we should first understand Loopring orders. At its root, the Loopring protocol is a social protocol in the sense that it relies on coordination amongst members to operate effectively towards a goal. This is not dissimilar to cryptoeconomic protocols at large, and indeed, its usefulness is largely protected by the same mechanisms of coordination problems [20], grim trigger equilibrium, and bounded rationality.\n\nThe Loopring Protocol can facilitate trading between ERC20 tokens. Loopr needs to convert Ether to Ether Token for trading as Ether is not ERC20 compatible, but Ether Token is. Converting between Ether and Ether Token will be done for you automatically when you submit an order, but if you want to trade frequently, we strongly suggest you to convert some Ether to Ether Token beforehand manually; otherwise each order will take one more blockchain transaction just for the ETH-WETH conversion which takes time and gas. Conversions between ETH and WETH are done on-chain through Ethereum transactions. ETH and WETH are always converted 1:1 which is guaranteed by the WETH smart contract. The WETH smart contract also guarantees the total WETH issued is exactly the total ETH deposited. In other words, ETH and WETH is equiviate in value, and WETH is just the ERC20 form of ETH.\n\nThe Loopring blockchain project had managed to raise almost 15 million US dollars during the period of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/loopring\">Loopring ICO</a>, as all the regulatory experts watched this unprecedented crowdfunding. Daniel Wang, the founder and the main person behind the Loopring ICO, hand made it very transparent that the interface is quite bad but the underlying mechanism and the Order matching facility is very great. Loopring mining can be initiated very easily by using various performance calculating devices such as CPU, GPU, as well as application specific integrated circuits. The Loopring mining process can be initiated through the high-end Linux systems, according to reports. Loopring mining is basically a metaphor which is not similar to the Bitcoin mining but here the users need to match the specific orders from a huge database.  Specifically, Loopring mining requires the usage of the ethereum nodes along with JSON API, IPFS, etc.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/loopring-lrc/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review of Loopring.","id":"loopring","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2069498,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd","https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd"],"homepage":["https://loopring.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Loopring/lightcone","https://github.com/Loopring/loopr","https://github.com/Loopring/protocol2","https://github.com/Loopring/protocols","https://github.com/Loopring/relay"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/loopring","telegram_channel_identifier":"loopringorg","twitter_screen_name":"loopringorg"},"name":"Loopring","symbol":"lrc","tickers":[{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"bitasset","name":"BitAsset"},"target":"CNYT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"bitasset","name":"BitAsset"},"target":"TWD"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"idax","name":"Idax"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"75DF52AE-008E-47FB-8F1F-8C0D2FDAEAB0","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"75DF52AE-008E-47FB-8F1F-8C0D2FDAEAB0","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"otcbtc","name":"OTCBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"switcheo","name":"Switcheo"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"syex","name":"Shangya Exchange"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"tokenomy","name":"Tokenomy"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"tokok","name":"TOKOK"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"LRC","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xEa11755Ae41D889CeEc39A63E6FF75a02Bc1C00d","description":"Cortex is built on a new public chain called Cortex. The chain includes AI algorithms that support smart contracts, which means anyone can use Cortex to add AI to their smart contracts. It also creates an incentive mechanism for collective collaboration, allowing anyone to submit and optimize models in Cortex, while model contributors can also be rewarded. The end result of Cortex, according to the whitepaper, is the creation of \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d, or AGI, \u201cbeing born on the Cortex\u201d. Cortex completed a private token sale in February/March 2018 for its CTXC tokens. That funding round was led by Bitmain and FBG Capital, among other well-known investors in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nPlacing artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain isn\u2019t a straightforward process. However, Cortex will solve this problem by allowing machine learning researchers around the world to upload well-trained corresponding data models to the storage layer of the Cortex public chain. Other users who need these AI models can make inferences using the models, then pay the person who developed those models. At each inference, a full node synchronizes the model and the data from the storage tier to the local site. Making an inference using Cortex\u2019s unique virtual machine, or CVM, will synchronize the results to the whole network and then return the result. Every time a user initiates a transaction on the Cortex, opens a smart contract, or performs an intelligence inference, the user will need to pay a certain number of \u201cEndorphin\u201d tokens.\n\nEndorphin is the pricing unit for transactions on Cortex. However, the platform will have two tokens, including Endorphins and Cortex Coins (CTXC). The overall goal of Cortex is to provide state-of-the-art machine learning models on the blockchain where users can infer using smart contracts. Cortex also seeks to create a machine learning platform where users can post tasks on the platform or submit artificial intelligence-based decentralized apps.\n\nCortex\u2019s token sale began with a single private placement round. That round took place from February 7 to March 7, 2018, during which tokens were sold at a price of 1 ETH = 1500 CTXC. In March 2018, the company announced that it had reached its target cap of 40,000 ETH for 60 million CTXC, or 20.01% of the total token distribution. FBG Capital and Bitmain were lead investors during the token sale. CTXC tokens are ERC20 tokens on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain. There\u2019s a total supply of 299,792,458 tokens. Of the total supply, 50.03% (150 million) are reserved for Cortex coin miners as a mining reward, 24.95% (74,792,458) are dedicated to the project\u2019s foundation from the genesis block (including 15.01% to the Cortex Lab, 9.01% to project marketing, and 0.93% to challenge bounties), with the remaining 5% going to advisors, academia, and the community from the genesis block.\nCortex aims to place advanced artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain. The company recently completed a private investment round during its token sale for CTXC tokens in February/March 2018. The next step is to roll out the Cortex public chain. Key features of the platform include its smart AI contracts and its Cortex Virtual Machine, both of which allow for advanced AI-based smart contract programming.","id":"cortex","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xea11755ae41d889ceec39a63e6ff75a02bc1c00d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xea11755ae41d889ceec39a63e6ff75a02bc1c00d"],"homepage":["http://www.cortexlabs.ai/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/CortexFoundation/Cortex_Release","https://github.com/CortexFoundation/ncnn"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cortex_Official/","twitter_screen_name":"CTXCBlockchain"},"name":"Cortex","symbol":"ctxc","tickers":[{"base":"CTXC","market":{"identifier":"bigmarkets","name":"BIG

By creating a network powered by Bluetooth - or WIFI, if available - the mesh network sidesteps typical cellular and data costs imposed by the incumbents.\n\nBlockMesh started in 2015 as a mesh network provider. A mesh network is a group of devices passing information from one to another until the recipient is reached. We are using this mesh network as a communications application, and as it can operate via Bluetooth and wifi instead of data, it is essentially cost-free once you\u2019re on the network.

Enjin is the \u201clargest gaming community platform online\u201d with over 250,000 gaming communities and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that\u2019s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.\n\nEnjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It\u2019s also one of the first projects testing the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a>, Ethereum\u2019s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we\u2019ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that\u2019s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc\u2026) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\n\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform \u2013 over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it\u2019s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They\u2019ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\n\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list.

It enables people across the globe to access credit, and to provide loans. The RCN token is a typical ERC-20 token. This protocol has the smart contract technology embedded into the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain which facilitates peer-to-peer lending without the hefty transaction fees that are charged in traditional banking processes. The RCN token functions at the core of the system. The inherent value of the token is directly correlated to the demand for its use in the network.\n\nBased in Argentina, Latin America, Ripio was launched at the TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2016. Sebastian Serrano, founder and CEO of the Ripio Credit Network is a technology enthusiast. He along with his team of technology experts, analysts and developers have designed an impressive concept along with the website, whitepaper and its implementation within the last 2 years. The team comprises of David Garcia (SVP & Board Member), Eugenio Cocimano (Data Scientist), Antonio Ceraso (CTO & Lead Blockchain developer) and Agustin Aguilar (Smart Contracts Developer) among many others. Ripio started off with a primary objective - to democratize the digital economy in Latin America, by offering digital payment alternatives within everyone's reach in a region where 65% remain unbanked.\n\nThe smart contract is an integral part of the underlying technology of the Ripio Credit Network. It is generated by the Wallet Provider and executed when it is matched by the Credit Exchange. This smart contract contains information like the relevant credit terms, borrower obligations, events of default along with the signatures or verifications from all other agents. RCN tokens facilitate interaction with the smart contracts among different agents within the RCN. Every credit flow starts when the Borrower makes a credit request. The Borrower performs the request from its Wallet Provider, which has already integrated into the RCN protocol. Post this, the Borrower waits for an approval before any further action can be performed.","id":"ripio-credit-network","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2202647,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xf970b8e36e23f7fc3fd752eea86f8be8d83375a6","https://etherscan.io/token/0xf970b8e36e23f7fc3fd752eea86f8be8d83375a6","https://ethplorer.io/search/0xf970b8e36e23f7fc3fd752eea86f8be8d83375a6"],"homepage":["https://ripiocredit.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ripio/rcn-network"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RipioCreditNetwork","telegram_channel_identifier":"RCNtalk","twitter_screen_name":"RCN_token"},"name":"Ripio Credit Network","symbol":"rcn","tickers":[{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"chaoex","name":"CHAOEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"RCN","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0xFA1a856Cfa3409CFa145Fa4e20Eb270dF3EB21ab","description":"IOST is building an ultra-high TPS blockchain infrastructure to meet the security and scalability needs of a decentralized economy. Led by a team of proven founders and backed by $40 million from world-class investors, including Sequoia and Matrix, IOST aims to be the underlying architecture for the future of online services.\n\nThe powerful consensus algorithm \u201cProof-of-Believability\u201d enables next-gen transaction throughput speeds while ensuring nodes stay compliant, using factors including IOST token balance, reputation-based token balance, network contributions and user behaviors. A faster grade Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism, microstate blocks, Atomic Commit protocol and a dynamic sharding protocol (Efficient Distributed Sharding) all ensure transactions are safeguarded, consistent and lightning fast while reducing storage, configuration costs and processing power for validators.\n\nAnyone is able to participate in every layer of our system, from using services on our blockchain to running a node and validating transactions. Our rules and code are open for all to see and no preconditions will limit participation. IOST aims to fundamentally disrupt previous methods of business by creating a self-operated, trustless network that maximizes network value for all parties. The project places great emphasis on decentralized and secure ways of storing information. It also provides for Dapps and smart contracts, and anyone who is familiar with blockchain technology knows just how integral these two concepts have become.\n\nAdhering to the quintessential egalitarian values of blockchain technology, IOST is creating a censorship-resistant and trustless network that is open to all, using blockchain technology to cut out middlemen and maximize network value for all parties.\n\nTerrace Wang, Kimmy Zhong, and Ray Xiao, who are extremely brilliant, have co-founded the project. In addition to these original three, the project has 12 employees and 4 advisors. It is also worth noting that Ryan Bubiski, a co-founder of CodeAcademy and a winner of Times Most Influential People award plays a major role in the advisory board of the project. The team has partnered with about sixteen blockchain and cryptocurrency oriented companies such as Sequoia, Nirvana Capital, and DFund. The project, therefore, has strong investors.\"","id":"iostoken","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@iostoken"],"blockchain_site":["https://explorer.iost.io","https://www.iostabc.com"],"facebook_username":"IOSTofficial","homepage":["http://iost.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/iost-official/explorer","https://github.com/iost-official/go-iost","https://github.com/iost-official/iost-webapp"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IOStoken/","telegram_channel_identifier":"officialios","twitter_screen_name":"iostoken"},"name":"IOST","symbol":"iost","tickers":[{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"bleutrade","name":"bleutrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"bleutrade","name":"bleutrade"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"bleutrade","name":"bleutrade"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"coinbig","name":"COINBIG"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"IOS","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOS","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOS","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"fex","name":"FEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"gbx","name":"Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"XRP"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"oceanex","name":"Oceanex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"IOST","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xFA3118B34522580c35Ae27F6cf52da1dBb756288","description":"LinkEye is a Hyperledger Fabric based consortium-blockchain solution tofacilitate global credit alliance.

It\u2019s an enterprise-grade web services stack built on an architecture containing many different \u201cmicro-services\u201d. It uses a decentralized, cost-effective cloud computing system organized by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, with no single authority holding the monopoly for computing resource distribution.\n\nThe DADI team consists of 18 full-time members, with engineers, strategic team members and designers, boasting of over 300 years of experience put together. Joseph Denne, the founder and CEO, is an expert in multi-agent and blockchain tech, as well as a pioneer in big data and machine learning, with over 20 years of experience developing data and content platforms. The co-founder and key architect behind DADI\u2019s decentralized business strategy, Chris Mair is no less qualified, being head of the strategy in Airlock and Diesel before DADI. The Technical Director James Lambie was previously Lead Developer for BBC Worldwide and Barclays Bank before that.\n\nDADI is on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain, so any wallet that supports Ethereum would be compatible with storing DADI tokens. This also means that no DADI mining is supported. A hardware DADI wallet will be the most secure, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-an-ethereum-wallet\">Ledger Nano S</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en\">Trezor</a> work for Ethereum, and so by default, for DADI.\n\nExodus and Mist are desktop wallets which support the Ethereum blockchain, compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac.\nJaxx is a versatile wallet, compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, iOS and Android smartphones, and Chrome and Firefox web extensions.

The system is made up of the combined power of user\u2019s machines from personal PCs to entire datacenters. Golem is able to compute almost any tasks from CGI rendering through machine learning to scientific learning. It utilizes an <a href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">ethereum</a>-based transaction system to clear payments between providers, requestors and software developers however it is safe because all computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the hosts\u2019 systems.\n\nThe company released Brass in 2016 which includes Blender and LuxRender which are the two tools for CGI rendering. There are three releases that follows which are Clay, Stone and Iron. Golem has recently updated their Brass Beta and the highlight of this upgrade are the streamlined task creation GUI, the support for partial task restart in case of subtask timeouts and the fix that should alleviate the issues with the Docker service on Windows. Other than that, improvements have been made on the Blender verification and transaction tracking subsystems and fixed some minor pain-points in the UX. Transaction history will become more user-friendly with separate tabs for payments and incomes. Apart from that, improvements are made for requestors as well, requestors is now able to add resource file without having to repeat the task creation procedure if they have forgotten to add them beforehand.\n\nGrand vision and core features\n\u25cf Golem is the first truly decentralized supercomputer, creating a global market for computing power. Combined with flexible tools to aid developers in securely distributing and monetizing their software, Golem altogether changes the way compute tasks are organized and executed. By powering decentralized microservices and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for future Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.\n\n\u25cf Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users (\"requestors\") to rent resources of other users\u2019 (\"providers\") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem\u2019s built-in feature set is a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">Ethereum-based</a> transaction system, which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.\n\n\u25cf The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power can be considered both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is free to create and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry. Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize the payment mechanism resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/golem-gnt/\">CoinBureau</a> for the full review of Golem.","id":"golem","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1655002,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xa74476443119a942de498590fe1f2454d7d4ac0d","https://etherscan.io/token/0xa74476443119A942dE498590Fe1f2454d7D4aC0d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa74476443119A942dE498590Fe1f2454d7D4aC0d"],"facebook_username":"golemproject","homepage":["https://golem.network/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.golemproject.net/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/golemfactory/concent-deployment","https://github.com/golemfactory/golem","https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron","https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages","https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-unlimited"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject","twitter_screen_name":"golemproject"},"name":"Golem","symbol":"gnt","tickers":[{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"buyucoin","name":"BuyUcoin"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"codex","name":"CODEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"coinmex","name":"CoinMex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"sistemkoin","name":"Sistemkoin"},"target":"TL"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"tokenize","name":"Tokenize"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"tradeio","name":"Trade.io"},"target":"TIO"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"vebitcoin","name":"Vebitcoin"},"target":"TRY"},{"base":"GNT","market":{"identifier":"vindax","name":"Vindax"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xa7f976C360ebBeD4465c2855684D1AAE5271eFa9","description":"Blockchain lottery.

Using blockchain technology, OriginTrail can append immutable data to products as they take each step along the supply route. Thus, each participant not only verifies that their conditions are being met but that at every previous stage, the right conditions were also met by everyone else. This is achieved by making an application layer that allows data to be collected in the real world, and then stored on the blockchain. OriginTrail started out by testing their tracking with organic beef products in 2014, and they are still mostly involved in the tracking of food products in general. It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that they introduced a blockchain into their system.\n\nIn January 2018, they raised US$22.5 million in their ICO. Since their ICO they\u2019ve successfully launched their testnet, implemented privacy features, and achieved compliance with the GS1 standards that are integral to their business model. Their roadmap is robust and full of details, citing certifications with international bodies, alliances with companies, and entering new markets. Their mainnet is scheduled for launch in Q3 2018, and thereafter they appear to be on track to having all their services fully operational by 2020.\n\nOriginTrail is not the first or only company to recognize that supply chains could benefit a great deal from blockchain technology. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ambrosus\">Ambrosus</a> is also going for the same market, though they seem to be focused on food and pharmaceuticals specifically. It should be noted that most supply chains have their own specific quirks, and so specialization might be be a good option. Another potential competitor of OriginTrail is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waltonchain\">Waltonchain</a>, a company based in China that puts heavy emphasis on RFID chip scanning as part of their business model. In other words, where OriginTrail wants to leverage existing systems for their infrastructure, Waltonchain wants to try and establish new standards and methods. OriginTrail\u2019s token is called TRAC, and it\u2019s an ERC-20 token, making it storable on any ERC-20 compatible wallet. The total supply is capped at 500 million tokens. The value in TRACE tokens comes from their utility on the OriginTrail network. Tokens are spent to store, retrieve, and send data about supply chains. Since TRACE can be bought and sold in a speculative market, that creates the potential for the price to go up, which would be counter to the needs of people on the network looking for stable prices for setting and getting data. However, prices for data saving and retrieval will be determined by auction, which should counter increasing token value for those using OriginTrail as a service.\n\nThe Internet of Things is a topic that gets a lot of press, and the general consensus is that it will be standard practice in the future for almost everything in the world to be tracked and traced for a wide variety of purposes. OriginTrail is one company that is demonstrating a concrete plan for exactly how that will be manifest. There really isn\u2019t much to criticize in terms of the overall intention of the project. OriginTrail has identified a weak point in the very important world of supply chain management, that of reliable transfer of information all the way up and down the chain, and aims to provide a workable and clearly understood solution.","id":"origintrail","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2436140,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f","https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f"],"facebook_username":"origintrail","homepage":["https://origintrail.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/origintrail","telegram_channel_identifier":"origintrail","twitter_screen_name":"origin_trail"},"name":"OriginTrail","symbol":"trac","tickers":[{"base":"TRAC","market":{"identifier":"dextop","name":"DEx.top"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TRAC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TRAC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TRAC","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"TRAC","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xaAAf91D9b90dF800Df4F55c205fd6989c977E73a","description":"","id":"tokencard","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/tokencard "],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1887092,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xaaaf91d9b90df800df4f55c205fd6989c977e73a","https://etherscan.io/token/0xaaaf91d9b90df800df4f55c205fd6989c977e73a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xaaaf91d9b90df800df4f55c205fd6989c977e73a"],"homepage":["https://tokencard.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/tokencard/MultiSigWallet"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tokencard","twitter_screen_name":"tokencard_io"},"name":"TokenCard","symbol":"tkn","tickers":[{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"TKN","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xaB2282E27533749d7883E24F82dc8DFa2B3e3C85","description":"Stellar Classic Ecosystem is a modern age freelance marketplace created with the aim to resolve issues faced by traditional freelance industry and enable seamless, risk-free connectivity between free-lancers and buyers at minimal costs.","id":"stellar-classic","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xab2282e27533749d7883e24f82dc8dfa2b3e3c85"],"facebook_username":"Stellarclassics","homepage":["http://stellarclassics.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"stellarclassics","twitter_screen_name":"classicsstellar"},"name":"Stellar Classic","symbol":"xlmx","tickers":[{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"coinchangex","name":"Coinchangex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"eosex","name":"EOSex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"XLMX","market":{"identifier":"ooobtc","name":"OOOBTC"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xaBb77F5c1E1C61adC3666b62dC614e64c584bE6b","description":"Truecoin is the first fiat global information carrier.","id":"truecoin","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xabb77f5c1e1c61adc3666b62dc614e64c584be6b"],"homepage":["https://truecoin.icu"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"Truecoin2","twitter_screen_name":"tcoinofficial"},"name":"TRUECOIN","symbol":"tcoin","tickers":[{"base":"TCOIN","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xaBbBB6447B68ffD6141DA77C18c7B5876eD6c5ab","description":"DATx, a new blockchain, with collaboration with QTUM Foundation and Avazu (a leading advertising platform with global coverage) -

Unlike other legacy systems, Arbitrage\u2019s aBot doesn't sell but actually short sells designated cryptocurrencies on the short exchange, this feature offers two important advantages.\n\nFirst, the strategy is always market-neutral, meaning as the cryptocurrency market's moves (up or down) it doesn't impact the strategy of returns. In simple terms, this removes a huge amount of risk from the platform\u2019s overall return strategy as the market could suddenly lose half its value and this won't make any difference in the strategy returns.\n\nSecond, the aBOT's strategy doesn't need to transfer cryptofunds (e.g. BTC, LTC or Fiat) between cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe buy/sell and sell/buy opposing trade activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges, independently.\n\nRevolutionary Decentralised Platform\nArbitraging ecosystem is collection of unique products and capabilities that is structured to realise the decentralised nature of the exchange and access to the Arbitrage BoT financial trading technology. The platform architecture either leverages the full scope of the Arbitrage Trading BoT (as detailed earlier) or provides unique storage and management functionality for the investor.\n\nThe proprietary decentralized blockchain provides a seamless approach to arbitrage fintech services by combining a number of noteworthy innovations from token storage and management, and a number of integrated functional services. Whatever the investor experience level, the interface has been designed to be accessible (i.e. mobile and desktop environments) with simplicity and functionality in mind. It focuses on features that will enable easy transactions and subsequent tracking, and the ability to use ARB Tokens to access internal products and future projects.\n\nARB asset management and storage options can be simply divided into two levels: external wallets for long-term storage and dedicated digital wallet apps. The decentralised nature of the exchange enables ARB stored on any external ERC20 compatible wallets (e.g. MyEtherWallet or MetaMask). This ensures that tokens are always held separate and furthermore when the Arbitrage trading BoT is active, those tokens are sent to an external cold storage wallet and the daily profits are sent back to the designated external wallet. Alternatively, the dedicated ARB-wallet application (currently under development) will be able to exchange directly with the ARB Trading platform thereby significantly reducing funds transfer and transaction latency. This integrated concept will also eventually feature for the ardent crypto investor, compatibility with hard-storage devices such as the Trezor and Nano-Ledger.\n\nIn summary the Arbitraging ecosystem presents an innovative approach to a complex crypto-trading strategy that is characterised by a proprietary ERC20 based decentralized blockchain, token management system and fully integrated external wallet and hard storage technologies.","id":"arbitraging","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xafbec4d65bc7b116d85107fd05d912491029bf46","https://etherscan.io/token/0xafbec4d65bc7b116d85107fd05d912491029bf46","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xafbec4d65bc7b116d85107fd05d912491029bf46"],"homepage":["https://arbitraging.co/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"arbofficial","twitter_screen_name":"arbitragingco"},"name":"ARBITRAGE","symbol":"arb","tickers":[{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"raisex","name":"Raisex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"raisex","name":"Raisex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade Satoshi"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade Satoshi"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade Satoshi"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade Satoshi"},"target":"LTC"},{"base":"ARB","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade Satoshi"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0xaFC39788c51f0c1Ff7B55317f3e70299e521Fff6","description":"eBCh is a tokenized version of BitcoinCash on the Ethereum blockchain","id":"ebitcoin-cash","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2255095,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xafc39788c51f0c1ff7b55317f3e70299e521fff6","https://etherscan.io/token/0xafc39788c51f0c1ff7b55317f3e70299e521fff6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xafc39788c51f0c1ff7b55317f3e70299e521fff6"],"facebook_username":"1528769833904071","homepage":["https://ebitcoincash.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"ebchcoin"},"name":"eBitcoin Cash","symbol":"ebch","tickers":[{"base":"EBCH","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xaaAEBE6Fe48E54f431b0C390CfaF0b017d09D42d","description":"For crypto to continue to spread and gain traction we\u2019ve got to bring the next 100m people into the crypto community.

SingularDTV is a blockchain entertainment studio laying the foundation for a decentralized entertainment industry. Building the future of rights management, project funding, and peer-to-peer distribution, SingularDTV\u2019s platform empowers artists and creators with powerful tools to manage projects from development to distribution.\n\nThe entire concept behind SingularDTV is a kind of \u201centertainment studio\u201d, which offers artists and creators of media content a large platform with many programs and tools that can develop and market their products there. The company\u2019s concept is based on 11 modules, some of which are already available as features on the platform, but some of which will not be released until 2018 or 2019. The modules are: Tokit, Decentralized Exchange, Codex, Launch Pad, Legal Repository, Production Service/Crew, Equipment Rental, Talent Management, Marketing, Union Interface and EtherVision.\n\nThe company was founded by Arie Levy-Cohen, Kim Jackson, Zach Lebeau and Joseph Lubin.The founders have the vision to create an entertainment platform that offers artists and producers a good marketing time on a decentralized basis.They are competing with streaming services such as Netflix or Youtube. The company will even publish the first specially produced television series on the platform in the autumn of 2017. This project is led by Kim Jackson, who is also a producer and president of \u201cEvotion Media\u201d.\n\nSingular-DTV wants to gather a total of $7.5 million. In order to do so, a crowdsale which will last for a month will be held. During this time 500 million SNGLS tokens will be up for sale at a fixed rate of 0.00125 ETH per SNGL during the first 10 days, and will drop by 12.5% every 4 days until it reaches 50% (in 12 days). These funds will be used to complete the \"Singular\" tv show, launch the S-DTV Documentary Division, buy a stake in the Ujo rights management platform and to develop the TVOD distribution portal. A minimum of 34m SNGLS must be sold, otherwise, the project will be canceled and all the investments will be returned.  Since the issuance of tokens takes place on the Ethereum network, you'll only be able to invest in the crowd sale using Ether.

COBINHOOD Exchange provides spot trading and margin trading with zero trading fees to maximize traders\u2019 profit and market liquidity. COBINHOOD Exchange has a utility ERC20 token, called COB, which aims to maximize traders' profits with benefits tied to the exchange.\n\nCOBINHOOD Exchange was officially launched on December 18, 2017, with the early platform and company developments started August of the same year. The project is incepted by the former CEO of 17 live streaming, Chen Tai Yuan, a 26-year-old serial entrepreneur, and former engineer at Google, Wei-Ning Huang. On September 13, 2017, COBINHOOD's ICO officially launched with the introduction of the COB token. The funds raised from the COB token ICO sale is used by the company to develop COBINHOOD Exchange. Few days later, actor Jamie Foxx tweeted his support for the ICO. On October 22, 2017, the COBINHOOD Exchange ICO ended  and received a total of 45,254.9 ETH (equivalent to US$13,216,883 during the date of ICO end) with 244,773,856 COB tokens distributed to 17,433 ICO participants.\n\nEvery kind of crypto assets deposited at COBINHOOD will be stored in an offline multi-signature (multisig) wallet. It is estimated that 98% of assets will be stored offline, while 2% of assets will remain in an online wallet allowing for faster user deposit and withdrawa. Each offline multisig wallet consists of 8 HSMs (Hardware Security Modules), which will require passcodes from 5 out of the 8 HSMs to be accessed. If one of the HSM administrators is compromised, the multisig wallet will remain secure. Furthermore, the administrators of the HSMs are located in different countries (geo distributed) adding to COBINHOOD\u2019s security system. Furthermore, all crypto asset deposits in COBINHOOD\u2019s online wallet will be backed by insurance. Self or bot trading will also be regulated in the COBINHOOD Exchange as the trading engine is equipped with multiple automated configurations to prevent self-trading of orders entered by the same person with multiple accounts. Furthermore, machine learning and data analysis will also be set up to bolster security mechanisms for self-trading restrictions.","id":"cobinhood","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2169745,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb2f7eb1f2c37645be61d73953035360e768d81e6","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb2f7eb1f2c37645be61d73953035360e768d81e6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb2f7eb1f2c37645be61d73953035360e768d81e6"],"homepage":["https://www.cobinhood.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cobinhood/cobinhood-api-public"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cobinhood","telegram_channel_identifier":"cobinhood","twitter_screen_name":"cobinhood"},"name":"Cobinhood","symbol":"cob","tickers":[{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"COB"},{"base":"SBA","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"COB"},{"base":"COB","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"COB","market":{"identifier":"cryptology","name":"Cryptology"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COB","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COB","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"COB","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xb3104b4B9Da82025E8b9F8Fb28b3553ce2f67069","description":"Bibox is an intelligent transaction platform for blockchain asset, jointly established by a group of senior experts who are enthusiastic about blockchain and have a thorough knowledge in the areas of blockchain, finance and AI, etc. The platform was created to spread the word about digital asset and enable digital assets to facilitate our lives.

It is created by the combination of technologies of RFID and blockchain, which push forwards the integration of block chain and the Internet of Things.\n\nWaltonchain combines blockchain with IoT (specifically RFID) to create a management system for supply chains. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of RFID technology and a pioneer in the space. Logistics systems are complex and commonly involve several different parties. As these systems grow, it becomes increasingly tough for businesses in the same vertical to coordinate with each other. On top of that, individual entities may have different processes that further hinder the ability to transfer data back and forth. Waltonchain uses RFID identification to track products during each step of production and distribution.\n\nThe data associated with each item is stored on an immutable blockchain that ensures its accuracy no matter where in the process it is.The Waltonchain team is loaded with supply chain experience. Do Sanghyuk, one of the co-founders, was previously the Director of the Korean Standard Products Association. The other co-founder, Xu Fangcheng was the Supply Chain Management Director of Septwolves Group Ltd. The team is getting support from their Chief Scientist Advisor, Kim Sukku \u2013 a former vice president of Samsung. Waltonchain has no shortage of partnerships \u2013 several of which are with Chinese provincial governments. The team is working with the Fujian government to create a \u201csmart maritime\u201d blockchain incubator, and with the Jinhu government to build smart air purification and monitoring systems.\n\nThe Waltonchain architecture makes use of a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake & Trust (PoST). Waltonchain innovates on the traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) model and integrates a node reputation based system into the consensus mechanism. PoST provides for adjustable difficulty for each node, to ensure that integrity in the ecosystem is rewarded. Waltonchain also gives sub-chain developers the option to choose their own consensus mechanism, for example, sub-chains can strictly just have PoS as a consensus mechanism, and not PoST. Waltonchain, by use of its RFID technology, has introduced a novel way with which blockchain can solve not only the inefficiencies found with supply chain management, but also IoT.","id":"waltonchain","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2127069,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74","https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74"],"homepage":["http://www.waltonchain.org/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/waltonchain","twitter_screen_name":"Waltonchain"},"name":"Waltonchain","symbol":"wtc","tickers":[{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"allbit","name":"Allbit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"allbit","name":"Allbit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"axnet","name":"AXNET"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"coinmex","name":"CoinMex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"coinnest","name":"CoinNest"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"coss","name":"COSS"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"hb_top","name":"Hb.top"},"target":"USDE"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"168F13BF-BFEA-4931-91FF-E449850D694E","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"168F13BF-BFEA-4931-91FF-E449850D694E","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"simex","name":"Simex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"simex","name":"Simex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"WTC","market":{"identifier":"simex","name":"Simex"},"target":"USD"}]},{"address":"0xb8e103b60A33597136EA9511F46b6dBeB643a3a5","description":"","id":"siambitcoin","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5074414,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xb8e103b60a33597136ea9511f46b6dbeb643a3a5"],"facebook_username":"SiamBitcoin","homepage":["https://www.siambitcoin.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"siambitcoin","twitter_screen_name":"siambitcoin"},"name":"SiamBitcoin","symbol":"sbtc","tickers":[{"base":"SBTC","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"SBTC","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"SBTC","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"SBTCT","market":{"identifier":"south_xchange","name":"SouthXchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"SBTC","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"SBTC","market":{"identifier":"trade_satoshi","name":"Trade

One of these problems is the difficulty in financing international charitable activities, primarily due to the lack of a centralized platform that allows transactions to be carried out without any difficulties. As an example of this problem can be considered incompatibility of payment systems with each other. Thus, VISA / MasterCard cards issued in Europe are not accepted by US payment systems, and some payment systems may simply not be available in any country.\nAlso, electronic payment systems, such as Advanced Cash, Payeer, PayPal and others - are simply not compatible with each other, and accordingly, they imply transactions only between users of the system itself. Of course, today there are questionable exchangers that offer exchange between systems for an increased percentage. With cash, the situation is even more complex.  Well, the final part of the problem lies in the fact that in recent years, our lives are increasingly included turnover of cryptocurrencies.\nIn this regard, the dev team of HELP token project decided to start developing a platform that solves all the problems of transactions for the needs of charity.\nA revolutionary idea in this area will be to unite charity and the crypto industry, so we can make a huge step into the future, and greatly simplify the implementation of international donations. \nThe developed platform will carry out the sale and purchase of HELP token, using any cards, and the maximum number of payment systems.\nThe platform will use blockchain technology, in a certain block of which there will be charitable foundations and projects.\nAlso, our team will developed:\nHybrid mobile applications for using crypto currency in charity.\nPlug - ins and widgets for sites that use payment gateways, and allow transfers by pressing one or two buttons, with easy configuration and code implementation in the site.\nYes, we create a brand that will be widely known in the field of charity, and, of course, will create the most necessary, useful, functional and convenient tools for this!","id":"help-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://blog.gohelpfund.com/"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2160815,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xbbc2045d335cb224228f1850b29173d9d7d7b989","https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbc2045d335cb224228f1850b29173d9d7d7b989","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbbc2045d335cb224228f1850b29173d9d7d7b989"],"facebook_username":"gohelpfund","homepage":["https://gohelpfund.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/GoHelpFund/gohelpfund-web-app"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gohelpfund","telegram_channel_identifier":"gohelpfund","twitter_screen_name":"GoHelpFund_com"},"name":"GoHelpFund","symbol":"help","tickers":[{"base":"HELP","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HELP","market":{"identifier":"mercatox","name":"Mercatox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HELP","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HELP","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0xbC647aAd10114B89564c0a7aabE542bd0cf2C5aF","description":"IONC is the official token of IONChain.

By laying out the fundamental blockchain infrastructure, Aelf enables businesses to focus on building up their own dapps on their own chains with minimum effort. Acting as the master key, Aelf unlocks the potential for inter-business communication and collaboration using cross-chain efficiency. Incorporating modern technologies such as cloud nodes and parallel processing, Aelf is the blockchain system that achieves secure transactions at commercial scale.\n\nAelf is one of the cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts following its massive commercial adoption initiative. The coin seems to be leading on the technology front with higher blockchain efficiency, which is why it's also anticipated to be the Linux of Blockchains. aelf is an operating system for blockchains which can be customized by their respective users. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol ELF, with a total supply of 250 million ELF. It was launched on 21 December, 2017 on multiple exchanges in China without any ICO and instead got private investors on board. This ensured better compliance as KYC was done for all investors with most of them being accredited, with a good track record in token investment.\n\nAelf was developed by Ma Haobao, who is also the CEO of Hoopox. The team is backed by a strong advisory board which includes Michael Arrington (CEO of TechCrunch and founding partner of FGB Capital). The team says it is working on unleashing the blockchain\u2019s potential into mass applications and industries. aelf is now working with Innovation Alliance for increasing the acceptability of blockchain technology which will ultimately increase adoption of aelf\u2019s blockchain. The team is focussed to develop aelf to improve other chains in the ecosystem by providing a template and infrastructure for interaction between the sidechains.\n\nAelf also has a rewards system \u2013 Candy. With the Candy rewards system, you earn points, convertible for ELF, by accomplishing simple, daily tasks. Tasks include liking and replying to aelf tweets, inviting people to the Telegram channel, and other promotional activities. ELF are currently ERC20 tokens. As such, you can store them in any wallet with ERC20 support like MyEtherWallet or Exodus. The Ledger Nano S is also a great option if you\u2019re interested in additional security.\n\nAelf is a relatively new competitor in the dapp platform race but already has solid support from large investment capital firms.

Through the creation of nuanced digital channels, ODEM makes it possible for users to come together to raise the quality of accessible education at a reasonable cost. Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within various industrial sectors. Not only that, ODEM provides students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities, thereby allowing international as well as local students to take ownership of their educations.\n\nODEM connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract-based payment platform. As a result, academic scholars can interact directly with one another and participate in the exchange of education and learning, without the involvement of intermediaries. This service allows users to access custom-designed courses and educational programs that can help them find a curriculum that meets their particular needs. Unlike the educational model used by online service providers such as Coursera and Khan Academy, where all teacher-student interaction is maintained virtually, ODEM creates customized in-person educational programs that prepare students for real-world jobs and businesses. According to the official whitepaper, the majority of ODEM\u2019s current offerings are onsite educational experiences.\n\nRichard Maaghul is the CEO of this venture. He has been in the startup domain for over two decades and has been involved with a number of emerging/disruptive technologies in the past. In addition to co-founding ODEM.IO, Rich has been involved with Chevron Corporation as an executive. William Bayrd II is the COO of this project. According to his LinkedIn profile, Bill is the founder of three companies, including big-name establishments such as Excelorators Inc. Bill possesses a D.Pharma from the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Michael Zargham is the Chief Backend Engineer for ODEM. He holds a Ph.D in Systems Engineering with a specialization in decentralized systems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Michael possesses more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience in domains such as digital systems and disruptive technology.\n\nTo invest in this company, we will have to buy its ODEM tokens. They are ERC20 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based tokens which can be used on the educational platform to trade for educational services. You will be able to buy the ODEM tokens during the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/odem\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a> as the pre-sale was already finished in December 2017. The sale will begin on February 17 and it will last until March 19. We will be able to use ETH to buy the tokens and you can store them in any Ethereum wallet. The tokens will be distributed as soon as the sale is finished.","id":"odem","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xbf52f2ab39e26e0951d2a02b49b7702abe30406a","https://etherscan.io/token/0xbf52f2ab39e26e0951d2a02b49b7702abe30406a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbf52f2ab39e26e0951d2a02b49b7702abe30406a"],"facebook_username":"odemio","homepage":["https://odem.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/odemio/onf-diceware","https://github.com/odemio/stakebank","https://github.com/odemio/zeppelin-solidity"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ODEM/","telegram_channel_identifier":"odem_io","twitter_screen_name":"ODEM_IO"},"name":"ODEM","symbol":"ode","tickers":[{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"bitmart","name":"BitMart"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"everbloom","name":"Everbloom"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODE","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"ODEM","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xbf85479AbcF60328cd7224f43ecD71e2f9A282f8","description":"","id":"resh","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xbf85479abcf60328cd7224f43ecd71e2f9a282f8"],"homepage":["https://www.resh.biz/"]},"name":"RESH","symbol":"resh","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xbf8fB919A8bbF28e590852AeF2D284494eBC0657","description":"ABCC Digital Asset Exchange will issue ABCC Token (AT) on July 9th 2018 (UTC+8) as part of our User Incentive Plan.\n\n1. What is ABCC Token?\n\nABCC Token (AT) is an ERC20 Token to be issued by ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. The total supply of AT is fixed at 210 million without any future offering.\n\n2. Benefits of AT\n\nAT is a blockchain-based token native to ABCC Digital Asset Exchange. Members holding AT will be able to get access to a wide range of benefits including but not limited to\u2014\n\nUsing AT for various products and services on ABCC. For example, members can purchase other digital assets, pay transaction fees and gain preferential access to premium services with AT.\nParticipating in various activities and campaigns on ABCC. ABCC will reward members who meet certain criteria. For example, members holding AT will share in 80% of trading commissions collected by ABCC.\nParticipating in various activities such as community building, interaction between members and ABCC, proposing suggestions to ABCC and others.\n3. Initial Allocation\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the initial allocation of AT.\n\n4. Issuance\n\nWe will adopt a mechanism called \u201cTrade Contribution + Simultaneous Release\u201d to issue AT.\n\n4.1 Trade Contribution\n\nIn order to encourage our users to trade on ABCC, we have decided to reward our members with 50% of the total supply of AT.\n\nOf the 50% rewarded to users, 4/5 (i.e. 40% of the total supply) will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism. The other 1/5 (i.e. 10% of the total supply) will be granted to users who traded prior to the issuance of AT.\n\n4.1.1 Trade-to-Mine (ToM)\n\n40% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward members who trade on our exchange platform via the \u201cTrade-to-Mine\u201d (ToM) mechanism.\n\nDrawing inspirations from the Bitcoin mining model, we have adopted a similar inflation model for AT.  In particular, the ToM mechanism includes two steps, i.e., \u201crelease\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d.\n\nRelease\n\nThe release of AT follows a half-life decay pattern. There are 6 half-life periods in total with each period being 120 days (roughly 4 months). We will release half of the total supply of AT in the first 120 days. The number of AT to be released in the following half-life period will be halved, and so on. Please see details of AT release schedule below.\n\nWithin each half-life period, one \u201cblock\u201d will be generated every 6 hours. The same number of AT will be released for every block inside the same half-life period. For example, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period is calculated as follows.\n\nThe total number of AT in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000;\nThe number of days in the 1st half-life period: 120 days;\nOne block will be generated every 6 hours;\nThe number of blocks to be generated every day: 24 hours / 6 hours = 4;\nTherefore, the number of AT to be released for one block in the 1st half-life period: 42,000,000/120 / (24 hours / 6 hours) = 87,500.\nDistribution\n\nWe will distribute AT released in a block to members per the percentage of their trading fees within that block.\n\nIf it so happens that there are no members eligible for the rewards in a certain block, the released AT assigned to this block will be distributed in the next block.\n\n4.1.2 Reward for Historical Trades\n\n10% of the total supply of AT will be used to reward eligible existing users.  We will distribute the rewards to the eligible users based on their cumulative trade volume contribution ending 24:00 June 27th, 2018 (UTC+8). The rewards will be frozen for 180 days after the launch of AT.\n\n4.2 Simultaneous Release\n\nAT will be released to the platform, team and investors in proportion to the number of AT released and distributed to members via Trade-to-Mine (ToM).\n\nThe number of AT released via Simultaneous Release = the number of AT released and distributed via ToM * (50% / 40%).","id":"abcc-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xbf8fb919a8bbf28e590852aef2d284494ebc0657","https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf8fb919a8bbf28e590852aef2d284494ebc0657","https://etherscan.io/token/0xbf8fb919a8bbf28e590852aef2d284494ebc0657"],"facebook_username":"ABCC-Exchange-558472047871367","homepage":["https://abcc.com/","https://abcc.com/markets/ateth"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"abcc_en","twitter_screen_name":"ABCC_Exchange"},"name":"ABCC Token","symbol":"at","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xc0223d4411440A5d7d4083e2Ebbf6F2A27Ac8d9F","description":"Trextoken is an ethereum base token with the aim of prevising easy transaction to help in promoting music and video download around the world","id":"trextoken","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5037135,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xc0223d4411440A5d7d4083e2Ebbf6F2A27Ac8d9F","https://etherscan.io/token/0xc0223d4411440A5d7d4083e2Ebbf6F2A27Ac8d9F","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc0223d4411440A5d7d4083e2Ebbf6F2A27Ac8d9F"],"facebook_username":"trextokenofficial","homepage":["https://www.trextokens.com/"],"twitter_screen_name":"trex_token"},"name":"TREXTOKEN","symbol":"txt","tickers":[{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"LTC"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"bitexlive","name":"Bitexlive"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"catex","name":"Catex"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"catex","name":"Catex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"catex","name":"Catex"},"target":"TRX"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"TXT","market":{"identifier":"raisex","name":"Raisex"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xc0EA6306F6360FE7dCAB65D16Bf1a3AF92C79Aa2","description":"GANA provides valuable information to users and collects consumer data.

The team is on a mission to solve one of crypto\u2019s most prominent issues \u2013 illiquidity. Most investors have experienced this first-hand: You find a digital asset you like and want to invest in. However, the coin is only available on a handful of exchanges. On top of that, you can only use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> to trade for it. This leads to a sometimes hour-long process filled with multiple manual transfers over at least two exchanges.\n\nPayment channels provide an instant way to transfer digital assets off-chain between two parties. The transactions are only recorded on the blockchain when the payment channel is first opened and when it\u2019s closed. You can think of it as updating balances on both ends of the channel for each transfer. Once you close the payment channel, both parties get their respective final balances. Payment channels are trustless \u2013 any disputes are resolved automatically through cryptography. And, transfers using them are secured by the underlying blockchain making them as reliable as exchanges on the blockchain itself. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a> are two of the most popular examples of payment channels.\n\nJames Wo (CEO), Terry Culver (CSO), Mikael Wang (Chief Blockchain Architect), and Kilian Rausch (Product Director) lead the Exchange Union management team.

Workers stake tokens in order to prove validity of their tasks and earn a reusable computed trust score, enhancing the cost-efficiency of the network while democratizing access to scalable micro task workers.\n\nGems, a decentralized, open-sourced, human task crowdsourcing protocol built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Using the Gems Protocol, anyone can tap into the power of scalable micro task workers without needing to worry about task verification, trust, or payments. Gems is designed to disincentivize malicious actors and reward fair players. The Gems Protocol is comprised of a staking mechanism to ensure task completion, a trust mechanism to track worker integrity, and a payment system to reduce transaction fees. The GEM token, a multi-utility token, fuels the Gems Protocol. Gems uses its token mechanism to enforce the behavior of all participants, instead of being regulated by a single operator.\n\nGems Protocol, aptly named the Gems Platform. The Gems Platform connects those who want work done (henceforth known as \u201crequesters\u201d) and human workers (henceforth known as \u201cminers\u201d). By using the Gems Protocol, the Gems Platform removes socioeconomic barriers that exist in centralized alternatives (e.g. large fees, market inefficiencies, need for bank accountants, etc.). Anyone can build on top of the Gems Platform, creating \u201cmodules\u201d that are interfaces for particular human tasks.

Health Chain (\u201cDHC\u201d), a decentralized healthcare service platform, breaks away from the traditional facility-centered healthcare model and instead establishes a blockchain-based medical data sharing network that enables universal access to high-quality healthcare resources and services across the world.\nThe world on average spends 9.9% of its GDP on healthcare and the U.S. even up to 17%. Medical costs across the world have been rising, though with poor care received by patients. For example, the misdiagnosis rate hovers high, and inadequate and expensive care is still a global issue.\n\nThe combination and rapid development of various technologies, including big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), is making an increasingly huge difference in a wide range of sectors. The marriage of medical data and the above technologies is set to disrupt the existing landscape of healthcare sector and reshape its value distribution. DHC and its partners in the healthcare ecosystem own the medical data of more than 30 tertiary A-level hospitals and hundreds of other medical facilities, plus top technical specialists and medical experts specialized in blockchain, AI and big data. DHC is committed to building an autonomous public chain to address privacy protection and secure exchange of medical data and establishing a DHC data marketplace and app marketplace by leveraging a variety of technical solutions, such as smart contract, decentralized distributed storage, proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, etc.\n\nDescription of Token (Utility/Use Cases):\n\n1. DHC Token mechanism\nAs DHT (Deep Health Token) is the Token issued on the DHC platform for the purpose of ensuring the effective operation of ecosystem and all activities in the DHC ecosystem should be linked by DHT, it is quite important to design a fair, just and reasonable Token mechanism.\n\n2. DHT incentive pool\nIn the DHC system, the DHC platform produces DHTs every day, which are stored in the Token pool and distributed to the original data contributors. The number of Tokens in the Token pool gradually decreases over time. The Tokens are distributed with the algorithm model. After distribution, the remaining Tokens on the current day are included in the Token pool on the next day\n\n3. Validator node\nIn the DHC ecosystem, the authenticated institutions or third parties can become the DHC chain validator nodes, which are responsible for the data verification and packaging of the chain and get corresponding remuneration of Token. However, in order to prevent the validator node from cheating to make a profit, each validator node should mortgage some DHTs in the system and will be subject to deduction of corresponding amount of Tokens in case of cheating behaviors, and the institutions will be listed in the blacklist until recharging DHTs where all Tokens of such institutions are deducted. Therefore, cheating is costly.\nIn addition, the validator node institutions extract the original data and make data standardized, then develop and provide data management DAPPs to users who utilize DAPPs to contribute their data to the DHC data market\n\n4. Data contributor\nThe ownership of data in the DHC ecosystem is attributed to users who can decide whether to contribute the data or not for specific purposes (smart contract limitation), and the user can obtain some DHT rewards in case of data contribution and the DHTs obtained can be used to purchase services in the application market. In terms of the data contributed by users, the system distributes the DHC-contributed Token pool on the current day in compliance with the POQ (Proof of Quality) model\n\n5.Data consumer\nThe third institution or the developer can purchase authorized data from users through the data mart to carry out analytical research and application development, etc. And the purchaser needs to pay DHT in accordance with the scenario and quantity of the purchased data. Expenditure of Token for using data can be calculated by POT (Proof of Times, proving the effective times) model, through which data are progressively charged based on the use frequency in a certain period. Specifically, the data used more frequently in the period is more valuable. Therefore, the consumers need to spend more money on the data, and the contributors can make more gains\n\n6. Application developer\nThe institutions or individuals capable of analysis and development can use data in the data mart to make analysis and development. Developed applications can be launched in the app store, available for users or institutions. It is also free to charge the application or restrict its application scope\n\n7. Application consumer\nUsers or institutions can choose what they need in the app store, probably paying a certain amount of DHT as the service fee.\nThe DHC platform uses ERC20 token of Ethereum as the Token before launch of the main chain. It switches to the DHT on main chain after launch of the main chain","id":"deep-health-chain","links":{"blockchain_site":["http://explorer.51ddkan.com/#/home","https://etherscan.io/token/0xcc771a11d368a76e6fa34b3aab8227297f48fe41"],"chat_url":["https://deephealthchain.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzU0Mzg2MjU3NjQ4LTQ3YzFkNWQ1ZWY0YjZmMzhlZDUwMTc4MTE4ZmQ4MTFjYTA3Njc0NTk0ODUyODcyMjY1ZDc1NzQyOTcxMzQwMTU","https://i.beechat.io/DeepHealthChain"],"facebook_username":"DHC.DeepHealth","homepage":["https://dh.life/index.html"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"DeepHealthChain","twitter_screen_name":"DHC_DeepHealth"},"name":"Deep Health Chain","symbol":"dht","tickers":[{"base":"DHT","market":{"identifier":"kkcoin","name":"KKCoin"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xcCeD5B8288086BE8c38E23567e684C3740be4D48","description":"SmartPlay.tech presented its users the second win-win roulette in which players will be able to place bets and receive a win using free bonuses and RLT tokens that are already traded on the exchange and have a real value having grown by 4 times for the last time.

Freelancers will make up a whopping 58% of the US workforce by 2027. Consequently, peer-to-peer booking platforms like AirBnB and Uber have seen a meteoric rise in demand accompanying these shifts in the job market. As the definition of work changes and evolves, the difficulties encountered by freelancers and part-time workers such as the lack of protection, and the insecurity of self-employment will only worsen. This not only affects the growing mass of freelancers, but also ruptures the social contract between workers and governments.\n\nConsumer protections have also weakened because of the murky legal relationship between freelancers and their host platforms. This simmering dissatisfaction has created popular backlash, as concerned governments in several countries such as France have begun to crack down on platforms like Uber and AirBnB. Despite these worrying trends, no workable remedy has been proposed - until now.

The decentralized network facilitates self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes and applications. OmiseGo builds an app with our SDK to enable wallet-to-wallet transactions of crypto and fiat currencies, loyalty points, game credits and more. It uses the OMG network to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on chain. Besides, it offers a decentralized exchange mechanism to provide multi-asset and cross-chain interoperability, that is scalable and secure via <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market\">proof-of-stake</a>.\n\nOmiseGO is building a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=9&view=market\">decentralized exchange</a>, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network of validators which enforce behavior of all participants. It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants. This high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from fiat-backed issuers to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and native cryptocurrencies).\n\nUnlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms, this allows for decentralized exchange of other blockchains and between multiple blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token. Markets may be able to significantly reduce spreads and encourage market assurance via decentralizing custody and increased transparency of market activity. This is achieved using smart contracts, protocol tokens enforcing correct market behavior of orderbook matching, a new construction of Ethereum bonded external enforcement of clearinghouse activity, and commitments to historical exchange data for use with Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nThere are several benefits such as access. Through the open source, white-label SDK, digital wallet providers can connect to the public OMG network to enable users to transact any digital assets, including crypto and fiat currencies. It has high security because bonding to the Ethereum blockchain creates secure token custody, decentralized exchange of all Ethereum assets, and ultra-secure transaction validation. It is very stable as the Plasma architecture allows for unlimited scalability with unprecedented transaction speed: millions, and potentially billions of transactions per second.\n\nOmiseGO allows for stakeholders, from individuals to issuers, to have significantly greater assurance in the financial mechanisms of society. With the emerging popularity of eWallet platforms, siloed networks are becoming a problem. This creates a unique opportunity for fiat tokens to interchange across a decentralized network, along with cross compatibility with cryptocurrencies. In order to build this decentralized interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities, as well as incentives around creating well-functioning liquidity pools.\n\nEventually, these issued tokens may asymptotically get closer and closer to full decentralization (including user-owned keys) which maximizes agency of the individual. This can be achieved by creating not only transparency in the business process of payment interchange, but also removing the ownership of the business process itself from a single trusted entity.\n\nThe OmiseGo team has already been recognized as up and coming \u201cFintech Rockstars\u201d by Forbes for their contributions to date. Omise contributed $100,000 in funding to the Ethereum foundation\u2019s DEVGRANTS which is a program to help new Ethereum focused projects, develop the code bases and implement community evangelism. This indicates their commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.This has helped them amass a fairly stacked advisory board. The OmiseGO board lists the co-founders of Ethereum, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">Golem</a>, Tendermint, Cosmos and even the Lightning Network as advisors. That\u2019s quite a justice league of crypto-superstars.\n\nAlthough many cryptos are focused on disrupting global banking, Omise and OmiseGO are actually following current trends in the banking industry. Their goal is to provide banking to the unbanked, something both PayPal and Stripe are also doing in a similar manner.\n\nCheck out <a href=\"https://www.coinbureau.com/review/omisego-omg/\">CoinBureau</a> for the complete review of OmiseGo.","id":"omisego","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07"],"homepage":["https://omg.omise.co/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go","twitter_screen_name":"omise_go"},"name":"OmiseGO","symbol":"omg","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xd26fb114401Ec86887CD09F62eccd95fCf20B571","description":"Bitcoin platinums.com shows the most accurate live prices, charts and market rates from trusted top crypto exchanges globally.

It enables Global medical services, which allow patients to meet with healthcare providers and receive health care at lower cost within a remote healthcare platform that crosses time, physical, and linguistic barriers.\nIt is also possible to maintain high security of the personal health information data registered or generated within the platform and to check the integrity of the health data to resolve issues such as falsifying or hacking increasing the reliability of the data.\n\nTMED remote health care platform will enable medical institutions to effectively utilize medical resources to provide health care beyond the time, physical distance constraints. This has the effect of expanding the medical market. Healthcare providers will be able to perform medical activities outside of the clinic, thereby expanding the scope of their activities and increasing the freedom of their activities, causing the current highly centralized system, to be partially decentralized. It also improves the disproportionate distribution of health resources concentrated in developed countries so that people in the Third World, a vulnerable region of health care, can receive high-quality medical care, thereby contributing to disease eradication and recovery.\n\nMDsquare team has built its own economically sustainable remote Health Care Platform using Ethereum to create their Token (TMED) for a Tokenized Economy Ecosystem to ensure that those who build and participate in the platform can receive and receive fair financial rewards for their activities. In addition, by enabling the use of TMED in actual offline hospitals, it is possible to connect the online platform to offline health care institutions and to guarantee and extend the value of the TMED.\n\nUsers are rewarded for storing and disclosing their health information, medical history, from self- tracking health devices that are associated with the platform. Healthcare providers can meet patients on the platform and provide remote video based medical services / offer monitoring-services based on personal health information / offer medical knowledge content thereby receiving financial rewards. These rewards will give incentives to platform participants to promote a plat-form that enables a sustainable economic ecosystem. The funds raised from some of the token used on the platform will be aimed at helping with disease eradication and providing health care services in developing countries and other vulnerable areas. TMED telemedicine platform will enhance the health of individuals and by extension it will enhance the health of the whole world.","id":"mdsquare","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@mdsquare","https://steemit.com/@mdsquare"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4459217,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd32641191578ea9b208125ddd4ec5e7b84fcab4c"],"facebook_username":"tmedtoken","homepage":["https://mdsqr.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MDsquare/","telegram_channel_identifier":"mdsqr"},"name":"MDsquare","symbol":"tmed","tickers":[{"base":"TMED","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"KRW"}]},{"address":"0xd341d1680Eeee3255b8C4c75bCCE7EB57f144dAe","description":"onG.social is a block chain based social dashboard that provides ease of control for both central-decentralized social media networks and that also supports community building and social interaction with cryptocurrency rewards.","id":"ong-social","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd341d1680eeee3255b8c4c75bcce7eb57f144dae","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd341d1680eeee3255b8c4c75bcce7eb57f144dae","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd341d1680eeee3255b8c4c75bcce7eb57f144dae"],"facebook_username":"OfficialonGsocial","homepage":["https://ong.social/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/onGsocial/-"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/onGCoin","twitter_screen_name":"Ong_Social"},"name":"onG.social","symbol":"ong","tickers":[{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"quoine","name":"Liquid"},"target":"QASH"},{"base":"ONG","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xd35833f9255FB28cC6b91aCB8A66Ba6429D6Ef5A","description":"Hypnoxys want to offer our industry a new way to be able to use instant messaging services without central party to worry about the security of your chats in an encrypted and transparent way using blockchain technology.","id":"hypnoxys","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@hypnoxys"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5112908,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd35833f9255fb28cc6b91acb8a66ba6429d6ef5a","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd35833f9255fb28cc6b91acb8a66ba6429d6ef5a","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd35833f9255fb28cc6b91acb8a66ba6429d6ef5a"],"homepage":["https://hypnoxys.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/hypnoxys/Smart-Contract"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"hypnoxys","twitter_screen_name":"hypnoxys"},"name":"HYPNOXYS","symbol":"hypx","tickers":[{"base":"HYPX","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"HYPX","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"HYPX","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"BTC"}]},{"address":"0xd36E9F8F194A47B10aF16C7656a68EBa1DFe88e4","description":"Atlas will provide a smart-contract based infrastructure that connects all consumers and businesses in the travel industry on a decentralized travel ecosystem that incentivizes content creation, transactions and consent-based sharing of user data.","id":"atlas","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd36e9f8f194a47b10af16c7656a68eba1dfe88e4","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd36e9f8f194a47b10af16c7656a68eba1dfe88e4"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/AtlasAnn"],"facebook_username":"atlasecosystem","homepage":["https://atlas.world/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasEcosystem","telegram_channel_identifier":"AtlasEcosystem","twitter_screen_name":"AtlasEcosystem"},"name":"Atlas Network","symbol":"atls","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xd37532D304214D588aeeaC4c365E8F1d72e2304A","description":"FT is the proof of rights of the FCoin trading platform itself, and it has an innovative \"trading or mining\" mechanism.

It makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to provide a global trading platform for invoice financing. According to the Populous website, \"invoice finance is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.\"\n\nIn order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices, either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\n\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice. If the invoice is repaid, you receive both your PPT investment and Pokens

Jury.Online also gives any person with expertise in a certain field the opportunity to use their experience and knowledge for paid dispute resolution.\n\nHere are several usage examples of the Jury.Online platform and protocol:\n\nOne party is a company that needs to design a logo or write a text according to certain terms of reference. The company is quite well known and pays well, thus expects the works to be performed to the required quality. The counterparty is an artist without any outstanding works who has not used the Jury.Online service before. The party wants to hire the counterparty, but needs guarantees that the job will be done on time.\n\nIn this case, the first party is the one interested in a potential dispute, as it may not like the result. The chance of a dispute initiated by the counterparty is small, since the money is kept on a smart contract and the party has no control over it.\n\nThe party creates a deal on Jury.Online, with money for the work deposited to the deal balance. When creating the deal, the party specifies that in case of a dispute, the counterparty covers 80% of litigation expenses, making payment in advance. This ensures that the first party will bear no losses if the counterparty does not do the job. The party itself pays 20%, guaranteeing to the counterparty that the party will not dispute the deal regardless of its result. This ratio (80% to 20%) is not mandatory and may vary.\n\nMoreover, the counterparty can make an additional deposit as an immediate guarantee of a high-quality result. In this case, the party may pay for dispute proceedings.\n\nThe counterparties are residents of two distant countries representing large companies who wish to execute a deal, e.g. goods delivery. However, they understand that if something goes wrong, fees for litigation in the other country will be significant. In this case, a deal with classic dispute resolution is not worth the risk. \uf0b7 Payment prolongation and warranty cases. Imagine that you want to buy a TV: you find a seller, buy the TV and bring it home. Everything seems fine, but it stops working a week later and the seller has already disappeared or directs you to a repair shop. Use of the Jury.Online platform would force the seller to be interested in resolving such a case.\n\nMoney can be transferred after the product has been delivered and used for some time, or any other work can be paid for after proper testing and examination. The payment can be divided into parts, with the next part coming only after the previous obligation has been fulfilled.\n\nJobs for experts. There are many highly qualified, diverse specialists all around the world who have skills, experience and a personal point of view concerning fieldspecific questions that are outside the competence of regular jurors. Thousands of these experts are currently unemployed and have no chance to take part in dispute regulation and be paid for their work, although they are knowledgeable enough in the topics handled in courts. Jury.Online helps people earn money with their knowledge, competence, skills, experience and independence of mind.","id":"jury-online-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@Jury.Online","https://steemit.com/@jury.online"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2273820,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xdb455c71c1bc2de4e80ca451184041ef32054001","https://etherscan.io/token/0xdb455c71c1bc2de4e80ca451184041ef32054001","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdb455c71c1bc2de4e80ca451184041ef32054001"],"chat_url":["https://juryonline.slack.com/"],"facebook_username":"Jury.Online.Official","homepage":["https://jury.online/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/juryonline/contracts"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"juryonline_community","twitter_screen_name":"jury2beonline"},"name":"Jury.Online Token","symbol":"jot","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xdb45FAeCa61C70E271BFfeAf66162Fa68a1c4def","description":"eBIT is a new ERC20 smart contract token.

Tapping on the protocol, developers can build payment flows and financial apps, including instant token swap services, erc20 payments, and innovative financial dapps - helping to build a world where any token is usable anywhere.\n\nKyber Network maintains liquidity through the dynamic reserve pool. The pool contains all of the Reserve Entities in the system. Having multiple entities in the pool prevents monopolization and keeps exchange rates competitive. When a user requests an exchange, the Kyber smart contract makes the exchange through the Reserve Entity with the best exchange rate for the user. By allowing external Reserve Entities, Kyber Network prevents centralization and opens the door to low-volume token listings. External reserves may be fine with taking on the risk of storing less popular tokens that the Kyber reserves don\u2019t list.\nTo prevent bad actors in the reserve pool, Kyber Network has few safeguards. The network will flag any exchange rate for special approval that\u2019s greatly outside the norm. To protect funds in a public reserve, Kyber makes all exchanges using them available through a transparent fund management model.\n\nThe Kyber team is impressive. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/loiluu/\">Loi Luu</a>, Yaron Velner, and Victor Tran are the founders behind the project. Luu previously created Oyente, the first open-source security analyzer for <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> contracts, and cofounded SmartPool, a decentralized mining pool project. Velner has been active in the Ethereum bug bounty program, and Tran is also a lead developer at SmartPool. The team has a well-rounded advisory board with the most notable member being <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitalik-buterin-267a7450\">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum wunderkind. In August 2017, Kyber successfully launched their testnet beta. They plan on releasing their live product in Q1 this year in which you\u2019ll be able to trade between Ethereum and ERC20 tokens.

It is a decentralized network protocol, with its correspondence being conducted by mutual data exchange between communication modules installed in these machines, like BLE and Wifi. In the Mesh Network, every machine, such as mobile phone, refrigerator, automobile, POS and robot, can be a node. And these nodes could communicate with each other without the traditional internet, because MTC is a totally- decentralized Mesh Network protocol.\n\nFor blockchain network and IoT of the next generation, MTC Mesh Network performs as the basic internet infrastructure.

Also, MTC can support IoT equipment in transferring data. In this way, network congestion caused by large qualities of transactions would have been solved, and expensive private network ,such as Lora and NB-IOT, is no longer needed for the IoT equipment, in this way,80% of the cost for the construction of IoT will be saved.In short, it will become the mainstream network for decentralized near field communication and IoT in the future.","id":"mtc-mesh-network","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xdfdc0d82d96f8fd40ca0cfb4a288955becec2088","https://etherscan.io/token/0xdfdc0d82d96f8fd40ca0cfb4a288955becec2088","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xdfdc0d82d96f8fd40ca0cfb4a288955becec2088"],"homepage":["https://www.mtc.io/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"MTC_IO","twitter_screen_name":"mtcmesh"},"name":"MTC Mesh Network","symbol":"mtc","tickers":[{"base":"MTC","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BIX"}]},{"address":"0xe0D95530820aAfc51b1d98023AA1Ff000b78d8b2","description":"PressOne is a new content distribution system base on strong foundation that has smart contracts.

The mechanism makes use of value-added computation through the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. This computation set is to be used as the Proof-of-Work protocol. This allows the mining process to not only generate MAN tokens but to also be used to power real-world applications.

Matrix now only has to deliver a working blockchain solution. MATRIX will be launching several community activities after its testnet launch, including a Bug Bounty Program and a Dapp competition, as well as introducing the MATRIX Blockchain Browser and Online Wallet Prototype.

Melon is one such platform that works through a blockchain protocol allowing easy and efficient maintenance of cryptocurrencies. Acting as a hedge fund, Melon presents a fully customizable administration of your digital assets. You can use it as an online vault that allows you to store and transact your funds through its web portal. Melon was developed to meet the need for a cost-efficient and technologically advanced hedge fund to manage digital assets. Reto Trinkler and Mona El Isa founded the company, Melonport AG in July 2016.\n\nThe company created Melon as a digital asset management protocol. It is a first of its kind system that enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network. Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across multiple <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> networks to provide better efficiency and security for the assets. With the Melon protocol, users can save both time and money for investing in a hedge fund. Additionally, there is no requirement of a third party approval from a lawyer or advisor.\n\nMelon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/melon\">ICO</a> was launched in February 2017 and sold out within 10 minutes. Melonport is aiming to bridge the gap between the portfolio managers and the investors by removing the role of the third parties such as law firms. Melonport\u2019s CEO, Mona El Isa comes from a strong financial background and is versed with the problems of the investment industry.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to be done on the Melon project, even though things are looking quite positive already. An audit of the protocol has been completed already, and the project continues to advance. No further specifics have been provided on the website, although it remains to be seen what the future holds. Bringing more value to Melon Coin would be a good idea, yet it remains to be seen how that might be achieved.","id":"melon","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1763204,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892","https://etherscan.io/token/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892"],"facebook_username":"melonport","homepage":["https://melonport.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/melonproject/protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melonproject","telegram_channel_identifier":"melonport","twitter_screen_name":"melonport"},"name":"Melon","symbol":"mln","tickers":[{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"bitsane","name":"Bitsane"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]},{"address":"0xed5A55797CAEcCA39811ac3cc0EE085caFc05953","description":"The Blockchain technology has brought so many innovations and opportunities with its decentralized and distributed confirmation infrastructure and algorithm.

Each participant of the system can convert the accumulated knowledge and experience into a digital property with the possibility of using it to purchase goods and services in everyday life. An econometric model of the system was developed on the Biznes Molodost audience, the largest business community of Russia and the CIS, which will make it possible to take all the advantages of Blockchain technologies.\n\nThe implemented functionality will allow thousands of people and entrepreneurs to share their experience, resources, capabilities and knowledge by writing posts, voting and commenting, thus getting a real value expressed in digital tokens of the system, easily convertible into other types of digital property and fiat currencies. Rewards can be received not only by the participants who demonstrate useful activity, but also by those who estimate their contribution.\n\nThe main idea of the project is to measure, preserve and monetize the value (benefit) that arises in the process of communication between people and is expressed as a change in the reputation coefficient. Keeping the information about communication and monitoring the change in productivity, it is possible to effectively evaluate each participant's potential value for the system and its members, which can be expressed by the reputation coefficient. Reputation is used as the main multiplier determining the size of the reward received by the user from the system and its participants.\n\nBiznes Molodost community includes thousands of successful entrepreneurs providing a large number of goods and services which are demanded by real people and can be obtained in exchange for BMT tokens.\n\nAn additional possibility of the BMCHAIN platform  or any business will be the opportunity to create its own Blockchain-application with the necessary logic based on the developed TokenAPI solution without the need to study the technical level of Blockchain.\n\nThe partner accepting tokens for the payment is offered the automated possibility of conversion of the tokens received into roubles. To accept tokens the system participant must provide users with a list of goods or services including a real discount of at least 20%. The reputation of the partner providing quality products or services in exchange for tokens starts growing along with the bonus tokens credited for the usage of the system and the number of partner's incoming and outgoing transactions. The amount of bonus tokens obtained when making transactions depends on the reputation of the user and the partner.","id":"bmchain-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@BMCHAIN"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2096750,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf028adee51533b1b47beaa890feb54a457f51e89"],"facebook_username":"BMChain","homepage":["https://bmchain.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/BMChain/bmchain-core"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"bmchain","twitter_screen_name":"BmChain"},"name":"BMCHAIN token","symbol":"bmt","tickers":[{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"everbloom","name":"Everbloom"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"BMT","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xf04a8ac553FceDB5BA99A64799155826C136b0Be","description":"We are aiming to create a decentralized video distribution network, where users will be the owners and beneficiaries of their content.

Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of privacy that\u2019s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the Smart Contract doesn\u2019t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.\n\nEnigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.\n\nEnigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they\u2019ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma\u2019s success. Guy Zyskind, Enigma\u2019s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT. He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT. Sandy Pentland, a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions, is Zyskind and Nathan\u2019s adviser on Enigma. With other advisors such as Alex Pentland, who sits on the Advisory Boards for Google and Nissan, CEO of Abra, Bill Barhydt and director of MIT media lab, Prof. Alex Pentland, it is hard to difficult a fault in the team.","id":"enigma","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2052215,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4","https://etherscan.io/token/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/SJK32GY"],"homepage":["https://enigma.co/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-contract","https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-core","https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-p2p"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EnigmaProject/","telegram_channel_identifier":"enigmacatalyst","twitter_screen_name":"enigmampc"},"name":"Enigma","symbol":"eng","tickers":[{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"alterdice","name":"AlterDice"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"chainex","name":"ChainEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"cybex","name":"Cybex DEX"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"dcoin","name":"Dcoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dextrade"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"etherflyer","name":"EtherFlyer"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"81FF816D-4CA6-4C88-A454-3F7A1B80F472","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"81FF816D-4CA6-4C88-A454-3F7A1B80F472","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"okex","name":"OKEx"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"tidex","name":"Tidex"},"target":"WAVES"},{"base":"ENG","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xf14922001A2FB8541a433905437ae954419C2439","description":"Many Insurers are exploring blockchain and smart contract supported products.\nYet an ecosystem is still missing.

The platform supports a crypto economy and is powered by Blockchain.

A desktop PC or tablet is all that is needed to create a state-of-the-art VR store, office, community or other space for business or entertainment. The MARK.SPACE universe consists of multiple VR spaces (units), in which each unit can be linked directly to its own top-level domain. The property right to the units is guaranteed by recording all transactions involving units (creation, sale, purchase or rental) on the Blockchain.

It\u2019s a project from 5miles, a leading e-commerce company and app in the United States. With CyberMiles, 5miles hopes to create the protocols and a library of smart contracts for the future of e-commerce. It accomplishes these goals with high throughput delegated proof of stake consensus and a new virtual machine, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> Virtual Machine.\n\nLast November, CyberMiles raised $30 million in an ICO, distributing 420 million CMT. The roadmap for the project indicates that the 5miles e-commerce app, along with its 12 million users, will begin accepting CMT as payment beginning this summer. At the end of this year, CyberMiles hopes to launch the v1.0 of its blockchain.\n\nCyberMiles is banking a lot of its potential success on the fact that it will launch to 5miles\u2019s user base. 5 miles is one of the top 10 most popular e-commerce apps in the United States. It has 12 million total users and does an estimated $3 billion in revenue annually.\n\nIf 5miles can get even a small portion of that $3 billion to transact in CMT, then it could be a huge boon for the token and the idea of blockchain e-commerce. Launching a platform at this scale comes with its own challenges and excitement. If the 5miles app successfully transitions to a blockchain-based backend, then it would be one of the largest enterprise applications of blockchain to date.","id":"cybermiles","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xf85feea2fdd81d51177f6b8f35f0e6734ce45f5f","https://etherscan.io/token/0xf85feea2fdd81d51177f6b8f35f0e6734ce45f5f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf85feea2fdd81d51177f6b8f35f0e6734ce45f5f"],"facebook_username":"cybermiles","homepage":["http://cybermiles.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cybermiles/cybermiles-token"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberMiles","telegram_channel_identifier":"cybermilestoken","twitter_screen_name":"cybermiles"},"name":"CyberMiles","symbol":"cmt","tickers":[{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"bcex","name":"BCEX"},"target":"CKUSD"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"bitker","name":"BITKER"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"COB"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cobinhood","name":"Cobinhood"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"coinbene","name":"CoinBene"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"BCH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"coinex","name":"CoinEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"dragonex","name":"DragonEx"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"gdac","name":"GDAC"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"INR"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"koinex","name":"Koinex"},"target":"XRP"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"lbank","name":"Lbank"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"lbank","name":"Lbank"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BTC","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"CMT"},{"base":"ETH","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"CMT"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"tokenomy","name":"Tokenomy"},"target":"TEN"},{"base":"CMT","market":{"identifier":"zgtop","name":"ZG.TOP"},"target":"USDT"}]},{"address":"0xf872F60A163701cB2cFC240D728eA3df51BA11F9","description":"","id":"trade-ecology-token","links":{"blockchain_site":["http://explorer.tdchain.vip/","https://etherscan.io/token/0xf872f60a163701cb2cfc240d728ea3df51ba11f9"],"homepage":["https://www.tdecoin.com/"]},"name":"Trade Ecology Token","symbol":"tde","tickers":[]},{"address":"0xf8b358b3397a8ea5464f8cc753645d42e14b79EA","description":"Airbloc Protocol redefines how data is collected, monetized and utilized.

It strives to be the most innovative and comprehensive source of knowledge in domains like crypto projects, technology, finance, law, investment, and more, on the web.\n\nThe cofounders of Lunyr are Arnold Pham, Andrew Tran, and Christopher Smith. The Lunyr ICO ended on 26th April 2017, with around USD 0.3 million in capital being generated. The open beta was then launched on 30th January 2018. It is based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The reward system which enables writers to earn rewards for authoring articles was also launched at the same time, allowing writers to earn LUN coins in exchange for quality pieces. Initially, Lunyr will mostly focus on the world of cryptocurrencies and related domains, with emphasis on up and coming projects. After an active and dedicated community of readers and writers is developed, Lunyr will branch into other areas such as science and technology, investment, finance, etc.\n\nLunyr is unique in its vision, and usage of the blockchain technology in order to provide a comprehensive, decentralised, crowdsource, and peer-reviewed vault of knowledge, open and free to everyone. Lunyr aims to not only be a knowledge encyclopedia for the web, but also intends to enhance the blockchain technology by giving DApps (Decentralised Applications) the ability to tap into the knowledge base and access real-time data. This innovative feature can be used in applications ranging from Virtual Reality to Artificial Intelligence. The decentralised and peer-to-peer nature of Lunyr allows all content on the knowledge-base to be free from manipulation, and censorship. Since all submissions are peer-reviewed by the community, the chances of incorrect or dubious data making its way onto the encyclopedia are very low.","id":"lunyr","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1818468,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xfa05a73ffe78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567d9","https://etherscan.io/token/0xfa05A73FfE78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567D9","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xfa05a73ffe78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567d9"],"homepage":["https://lunyr.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Lunyr/crowdsale-contracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Lunyr","twitter_screen_name":"Lunyrinc"},"name":"Lunyr","symbol":"lun","tickers":[{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"bigone","name":"BigONE"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"bitebtc","name":"BiteBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"purcow","name":"Purcow"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]},{"address":"0xfb725BaB323927cFB20FB82BA9A1975F7D24705b","description":"JoyToken is committed to deliver smarter games to existing and new casino players by giving innovative and creative games developers easy access to operators in our one stop solution.

From being totally paper based, it is now very much a digital market. In spite of the efficiency brought by digital coupons, the underlying payment processes remain overly complex with middlemen adding unnecessary costs. While the digital coupons can bring a fresh user experience and widen consumer reach, billions of consumers are still confined to a passive role as in a B2C market. Mezzofy (Hong Kong) Limited (\u201cMezzofy\u201d) has become one of the market leaders in Hong Kong and Asia and the Mezzofy Group now wishes to take a leadership role in delivering the efficiencies that blockchain unlocks, combining innovation in point of sale technology, coupon authentication techniques, the near ubiquitous use of social media and last, but by no means least, a considerably more fluid payments and settlements system. In so doing, it has the full support of a long list of high profile international brands.\n\nTo execute these changes, the Mezzofy Group is now embarking on a Token Generation Event (TGE), seeking to raise US$24 million. It is well positioned to deliver on these innovations. It has already issued more than 200,000,000 coupons and numbers such well-known brand names as Maxims Group, Starbucks and the Hong Kong Airport Authority among its existing client base. It plans to use the funds to significantly enhance the user experience in the B2C coupon market and to extend it into the still dormant B2B and C2C spheres.","id":"coupon-chain-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@couponchain"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4989769,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xfc4b9e2d71a7795102Eb0C0e8b5DA992946a62De"],"facebook_username":"CouponChain","homepage":["https://www.coupon-chain.org"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/mezzofy/coupon-chain-ico"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"couponchaintoken","twitter_screen_name":"Coupon_chain"},"name":"Coupon Chain Token","symbol":"cct","tickers":[{"base":"CCT","market":{"identifier":"coinzest","name":"Coinzest"},"target":"KRW"}]},{"address":"0xfcA47962D45ADFdfd1Ab2D972315dB4ce7CCf094","description":"iXledger is a groundbreaking platform for insurance utilising blockchain. iXledger is founded in London 2017, through encouragement of clients interested in efficiencies enabled through innovative technology.

It looks to give patients control over their medical history and data and choose who gets access to it. Currently, people have to undergo the same check-ups and provide all the details when visiting a new doctor. With MediBloc, all that information could be provided directly and save on precious time and resources and allow for better patient care and treatment. It also complies with HIPAA and prevents unauthorized access to the use of blockchain technology.\n\nMediBloc uses two different tokens: the MEDI token (MED) and the MEDI point (MP). The former is a crypto token that is used for giving access and making purchases, while the latter is a token that is only for the MediBloc network. MP is a points-based system to give users and organizations a better standing in the MediBloc platform. The only ways of earning MP is to either contribute to the network for its betterment or by buying them through MED tokens. Once you have MP, you can convert them to MED after keeping them frozen for three months. Users can use MED for payments outside the platform like insurance payments. However, MP is solely for the MediBloc platform and cannot leave it. You can only use them for intra- MediBloc purposes like verification.\n\nMediBloc has had a crowded sale in which 10 billion coins were available. However, the team had decided to burn all the coins that were left unsold after the auction; something that is almost unheard of in the crypto world. The team behind MediBloc explained that they wanted to protect the value of MED tokens and ensure that they had enough tokens to keep improving and developing the service further.\n\nMediBloc is a revolutionary project and one that was in the making for a few years. People have always said how the blockchain industry can benefit the healthcare sector. While there are other projects that look to do the same, not all of them are as promising as MediBloc. It gives control of the medical data back to the patients; also, they can choose whom to give access to their personal healthcare data and medical history.\n\nThus, sharing this data prevents going through unnecessary procedures and smoothens the treatment procedure. Security is achieved with the use of blockchain technology, which also provides immutability. MED tokens allow you to make payments for services like medical insurance, while MP allows users to contribute to the framework better.","id":"mediblocx","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@MediBloc/ann-medx-erc20-token-airdrop-faq-80940d20b55","https://medium.com/medibloc"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xfd1e80508f243e64ce234ea88a5fd2827c71d4b7","https://etherscan.io/token/0xfd1e80508F243E64CE234eA88A5Fd2827c71D4b7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xfd1e80508F243E64CE234eA88A5Fd2827c71D4b7"],"homepage":["https://medibloc.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/medibloc/erc20"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"medibloc","twitter_screen_name":"_MediBloc"},"name":"MediBlocX","symbol":"medx","tickers":[{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"coinsuper","name":"Coinsuper"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"dextop","name":"DEx.top"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"kryptono","name":"Kryptono"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"Probit"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"MEDX","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]},{"address":"0xfd8971d5E8E1740cE2d0A84095fCA4De729d0c16","description":"ZILLA will act as a gateway for crypto enthusiasts to easily and safely participate in vetted ICOs, while also allowing companies to publicise an ICO more effectively.

Libra Credit is a global initiative with a mission to provide financial inclusion and lower the cost of financial services. Powered by its proprietary big data, AI-based credit assessment technology and existing global partnership networks, Libra Credit has the expertise and capabilities to realize its mission. Libra Credit aims to offer a seamless digital lending process that can be completed in 5 steps: application, verification and credit assessment, confirmation, collateral deposit, and disbursement. The Libra Credit platform will focus on a dual-credit risk scoring mechanism that considers the creditworthiness of the pledged collateral as well as the credit information of the borrower. Borrowers will be able to pledge any crypto-assets as collateral and receive loans in their desired asset. Using smart contracts and a proprietary collateral valuation and liquidation system, Libra Credit will lock in agreed terms between borrows, lenders, custodians, guarantors and liquidators.\n\nLibra Credit was founded in 2017 and operates out of San Francisco, USA. They are backed by investors such as FBG Capital, GBIC, DHVC, Dekypt Capital, Crypto Parency, and others. Lu Hua, Co-Founder & CEO has experience in the payments, financing, and risk management industries. He was previously the CEO of moKredit, one of China\u2019s top digital credit servicing companies. Lu was also the Head of Core Payments for PayPal China and the Head of Global Banking Platform for PayPal US. Dan Schatt, Co-Founder & COO has previously worked as the Chief Commercial Officer at Stockpile Inc., a leading fintech company, and as General Manager of Financial Innovations at PayPal. Howard Wu, Chief Scientist, he is a blockchain and cryptography expert who is a Founding Partner of Dekrypt Capital, Advisor of Blockchain at Berkeley, and Software Engineer at Google. He advises the project in a technical capacity and has received a Master\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley.\n\nThere are already quite a few blockchain lending projects, so competition is stiff. Libra Credit\u2019s development progress is rather early compared to its competitors. The crypto-to-crypto lending part seems to be well thought out. However, not so much with the crypto-to-fiat part. According to the roadmap, crypto-to-fiat lending is scheduled to launch in 2018 Q3. With details lacking in the weekly blog update about crypto-to-fiat lending, it is difficult to gauge whether the proposed timeline is reasonable.","id":"libra-credit","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xfe5f141bf94fe84bc28ded0ab966c16b17490657","https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe5f141bf94fe84bc28ded0ab966c16b17490657","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xfe5f141bf94fe84bc28ded0ab966c16b17490657"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/UmJUTDJ"],"homepage":["https://libracredit.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/libracredit/LibraTokenSale"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Libra_Credit/","telegram_channel_identifier":"libraofficial","twitter_screen_name":"LibraCredit"},"name":"Libra
