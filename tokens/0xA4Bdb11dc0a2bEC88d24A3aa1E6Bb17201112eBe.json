Each StableUSD token is legally backed and redeemable for a US Dollar held in FDIC-insured escrow accounts managed by our fiduciary custodians, such as Prime Trust.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious problem with using popular cryptocurrencies for transactional purposes at the moment is price volatility. By making StableUSD redeemable and pegged 1-to-1 with US dollars, we can virtually eliminate volatility while still retaining many useful characteristics of a cryptocurrency - including fast transaction speed, anonymity, and immutability.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"stableusd","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/large/stableusd.jpg?1548758096","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/small/stableusd.jpg?1548758096","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/thumb/stableusd.jpg?1548758096"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe","https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe"],"chat_url":["https://www.instagram.com/stableusd/"],"facebook_username":"stablycoin","homepage":["https://www.stably.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"StablyCoin"},"liquidity_score":32.853,"market_cap_rank":511,"name":"StableUSD","public_interest_score":27.186,"symbol":"USDS","tickers":[]}
