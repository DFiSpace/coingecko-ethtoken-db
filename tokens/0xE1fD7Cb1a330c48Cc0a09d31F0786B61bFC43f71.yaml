  In the medical care industry, profound transformations are happening in data privacy protection, social
  resource integration, and AI utilization. Such transformations are challenges to the industry's deep-rooted
  problems brought about by new technologies and ideas. New technologies make it possible to turn ideas
  into reality, and ideas have long been guiding the direction of technological development. The ideas
  include decentralization and populism, which represent people's demands for the return of certain rights
  and a more equitable, flattened world. The technologies include blockchains, artificial intelligence
  (AI), and the internet of things (IoT), none of which work independently. These technologies need to
  work together to allow for industrial applications and business work-flows to be restructured and reach
  new horizons.


  In response to these changes and trends, ABO, based on its in-depth research and analysis in the medical
  care industry, plans to bring about the return of medical data ownership and management rights by taking
  advantage of distributed ledger technology. Meanwhile, ABO will promote the credibility and inter-operability
  of medical devices and enhance the st andardization of medical data. In this way, a secure, highly efficient,
  and cross-system data sharing system will be created. Finally, a credible environment will be established
  for services related to the use of medical data, including  data acquisition, annotation, storage, transmission,
  computation, and other services utilizing AI.


  ABO positioning: Medical data sharing and AI protocols platform.


  ABO objectives: Setting up a healthier blockchain medical ecosphere and offering a better medical service.
