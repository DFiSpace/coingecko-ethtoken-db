  Our goal is to unite researchers and gas companies to create an ecosystem that will bring gas technologies
  up to a qualitatively new level. To improve the environment, to optimise the consumption of natural
  resources, and to reduce the production costs of valuable compounds.


  The gas sector and blockchain technologies have a high potential for mutual adaptation. The huge capacity
  of the gas market itself comblned with underfunding of innovative approaches calls for investing a new
  type of money and a new type of contractual relations in this very field.


  RusGas is a promising technological project that opens the possibllity for everyone to make contribution
  to the scientific progress in one of the most important and profitable spheres in the 21st century.
  And also to take part in improving the environmental situation and preserving the planet's species diversity.
