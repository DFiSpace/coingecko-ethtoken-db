  The Hyperion Fund functions as a syndicated venture capital fund that provides independent investors
  access to the earliest stages of investing in blockchain projects.


  Through the IHF token, investors gain diversified exposure to a portfolio of expertly-vetted investments
  in private and public pre-sales, and ICOs.


  Invictus analysts leverage proprietary analysis tools (such as the Titan AI tool) to navigate the higher
  risk characteristic of these early-stage investments.
