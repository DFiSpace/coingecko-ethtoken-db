  ETHEREUMSMALL (ETS for short) is based on the intelligent protocol issued by ETHEREUMSMALL to decentralize
  currency. A total of 98.66 million copies were issued. Little Ether uses AI to simulate real people
  and staking votes to make decisions. The latest improved algorithm from Vitalik Buterin, 99% asynchronous
  consensus algorithm, is adopted. The perfect random number scheme of VRF verifiable random function
  + BLS is adopted, which provides an open platform for all intelligent contract developers of block chain
  and a safe and reliable payment technology for all platforms that need fast payment. ETHEREUMSMALL is
  creating a portable, deployable mobile intelligence contract platform for the world.
