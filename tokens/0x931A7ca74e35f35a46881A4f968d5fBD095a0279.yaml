description: >-
  FAIL token tries to bend the limit of deflationary currencies even more, transforming it in a Social
  Game. We are putting the distribution process in the hands of our community, and we try to make from
  FAIL the most distributed currency possible. How do we do that? By enabling a mint function for every
  token sent, and also by adding a second function for a deposit in the mother account. Once we reach
  the total cap, we start to decrease the cap amount by burning tokens, until we reach to our low cap
  amount when the treasure box is opened for our remaining token owners.
