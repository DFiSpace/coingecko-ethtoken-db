description: >-
  Qchain is building the first blockchain-powered custom content marketplace. Our platform will make it
  easy for for advertisers and content creators to buy/sell and collaborate on branded content, influencer
  marketing, and sponsorships. We released a functional alpha demo in October 2017, and we are advised
  by former NEM President Lon Wong, among other notable names. Qchain's larger vision is to build open
  and transparent marketing applications and technical blockchain solutions that support those applications.
