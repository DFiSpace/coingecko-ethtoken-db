  LEXIT is the first online marketplace that allows entrepreneurs to trade IP, copyrights, code, and even
  sell entire startups. LEXIT streamlines Mergers & Acquisitions through a blockchain-based tokenization
  model and the disintermediation of appraisement and matchmaking services. Selling or buying tech assets
  in LEXIT is as simple as purchasing a car or real estate.
