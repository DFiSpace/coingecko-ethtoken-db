  in our daily life. YUKI also connects Cryptocurrency holders through the YUKI Project, developing new
  society as the new 5th generation Cryptocurrency.


  The main concept of "YUKI-PROJECT" is to develop new econimic sphere to meet with demands of assimilation
  between Crytocurrency spheres and Local societies. We plan to start our business from development of
  solution business model in Hokkaido, Japan, where is "the advanced region on social issues", because
  those are urgent issues in developed country like Japan.

  We expand this solution business model to Japan, Asian countries, and the other nations. Our main business
  operation framework is based on following categories:


  1. Revitalization of the primary industry


  2. Local revitalization
