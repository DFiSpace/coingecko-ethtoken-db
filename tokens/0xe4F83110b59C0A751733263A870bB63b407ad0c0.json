It uses a decentralized structure to achieve value-for-money between the public chain, social, gaming, e-commerce, payment, and trading systems. The mutual support of a benign deflationary economy, the realization of the benign support and rise of the certificate value, and the change, is the only way for SPS to issue to the public in the early stage. The SPS hitting is the ETH to change the SPS. The SPS self-developed first hitting formula makes full use of the SPS team's unique social game gene. The early participants enjoy the fun and surprise of the game during the process of the change.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"share-public-system","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10111/large/sps2.PNG?1575963825","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10111/small/sps2.PNG?1575963825","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10111/thumb/sps2.PNG?1575963825"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe4f83110b59c0a751733263a870bb63b407ad0c0"],"homepage":["http://www.spsblockchain.com/"]},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":6352,"name":"Share Public System","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"sps","tickers":[]}
