  Bridge Protocol (BRDG) is building new tools and standards for businesses, KYC and ICOs. The Bridge
  Protocol provides enterprise solutions using blockchain technology to comply to global regulations.
  Our work involves creating avenues for safe, legal and compliant Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Bridge
  is creating an open, distributed network of validators which regulate the behavior of its participants
  to provide high assurance interactions.


  Bridge Protocol offers standardization tools for blockchain and non-blockchain business processes. Tier
  classification allows for compliance through contract code. These strategies allow for lower cost KYC
  and legal vetting between parties without the hassle. Our digital certificates keep your sensitive information
  off the chain and secure, so the user and business have instant points-of-trust.


  Bridge will allow existing integration to standard practices by way of digitalization of agreements
  like the SAFT, employment arrangements and more.


  Bridge BRDG tokens fuel the storefronts that offer identity services, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) solutions
  and access legal services providers on the blockchain.
