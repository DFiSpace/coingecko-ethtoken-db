  WFee is the world’s first decentralized WiFi sharing ecosystem based on the blockchain technology. Launched
  by Singapore WFee Foundation (non-profit), the ecosystem targets at entire world. As a result of WiFi
  sharing activities, WFee’s smart contracts are based on the blockchain address security, trust, willingness
  to share, privacy and other issues. With WFee, users are able to enjoy a convenient, free and efficient
  environment for Internet access. WFee enables each and every user to freely publish, store and manage
  their own WiFi information while providing a WiFi sharing chain for individuals or organizations transformed
  from the Ethereum at the bottom. Any individual or organization can get involved in the building of
  the ecosystem to form a decentralized ecosystem.


  WiFi Sharing Eco-system

  WFee will turn from one-to-many sharing network of the original platform to peer-to-peer sharing network
  in order to solve current trust issues between people and platforms and lower sharing cost.


  Hardware sharing ecosystem

  This will involve hardware, such as routers and IOT devices into the ecosystem and make use of the computing
  power of the underlying hardware to provide a complete data service platform for a single-function routing
  device so that WFee’s circulation, generation and consumption go beyond software function, which builds
  a more solid ecosystem combining hardware and software to expand usage.


  Data sharing ecology

  Users can record and store data on free nodes and exchange data with any other nodes in the network.
  In the process of data exchange and transaction, WFee’s circulation and data validity verification are
  handled automatically through smart contract, without intervention from artificial and central nodes.
