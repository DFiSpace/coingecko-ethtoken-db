  Bitcoin2x is Faster, safer and cheaper transactions than Bitcoin.

  SMART

  Bitcoin2x is built on Ethereum Smart Contracts. Ethereum smart contracts allow developers to build decentralized
  apps on top of Ethereum. This will enable Bitcoin2x to have more applications than existing platforms
  such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.


  CHEAPER

  Bitcoin2x will offer the lowest transaction fee in the market. Because of the challenges associated
  with verifying block sizes, the transaction fee for Bitcoin transactions is currently on the rise. The
  rise is necessitated by the need to pay miners more so that they can increase the speed of verifying
  transactions. For Bitcoin2x which is based on Ethereum smart contracts, the transactions fees will be
  even lower because of the efficiency of smart contract platform which is faster and cheaper than bitcoinâ€™s
  platform.


  FAIR DISTRIBUTION

  Bitcoin2x is owned by community. Bitcoin started as an opensourced community project but has nowadays
  been crowded by individuals who are now wielding too much power. The lack of community consensus has
  contributed a lot to some of the existing platform problems in the blockchain. Bitcoin2x will abide
  by high levels of community management and governance. This means that members of the community will
  be free to contribute ideas and other suggestions meant to improve the welfare of the whole community.
  There will be a unique voting system that will ensure all views are taken into consideration and a unique
  voting system for making sure only the best ideas get implemented. In the end, this will create a community
  that is more unified and have a sense of purpose and agreement than the current Bitcoin community.
