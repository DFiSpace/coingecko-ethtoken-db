description: >-
  EDAG is a parent blockchian product that provides a completely different distributed consensus approach
  from current blockchain solutions. It adopts the "Hashgraph" structure and consensus mechanism different
  from linear blocks to achieve the goal of distributed consistency, and is not limited by current blockchain
  technology. EDAG guarantees not only consistency, but also decentralization,high speed, provability,
  Byzantine Fault Tolerance, ACID compatibility, cheapness, anti-DoS attack and so on. It can be a more
  efficient (measured 3000+TPS) and more equitable (no need for competition for blocks) Internet trust
  layer which achieve the consensus on a large-scale but low-cost basis , and a more scalable security
  consensus agreement.EDAG is also an technology open platform that focuses on application scenarios.
  We will give priority to the application in the field of games, and continue to develop more application
  scenario models, allowing more developers to access the EDAG system and building a better community
  for more people to participate in and benefit from it.EDAG has the potential to become a truly trusted
  network for mass adoption and application, which will be an important milestone in the exploration of
  trusted Internet.
