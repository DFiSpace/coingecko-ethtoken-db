  Sentivate is a revolutionary advancement, not evolutionary, in Internet architecture. Sentivate has
  a hybrid topology consisting of interconnected centralized & decentralized systems. The network is designed
  to go beyond the capabilities that any solely centralized or decentralized network could offer. Sentivate
  has the ability to operate in a decentralized or centralized topology, if the need ever arose, giving
  it a unique dynamic topology. With Sentivate's data transport protocol, UDSP, all the issues associated
  with TCP will be a relic of the past. Sentivate is designed to be a realistic and viable replacement
  for the increasingly slugish Web we have today.
