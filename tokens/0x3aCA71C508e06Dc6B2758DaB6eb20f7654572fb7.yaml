  Decentralized Reputation System (DREP) enables Internet platforms to quantify, monetize, and share reputation
  value. DREP Foundation aims to provide a blockchain infrastructure and decentralized reputation protocol.
  These will empower existing Internet platforms to unleash their reputation value and achieve the interconnectedness
  of reputation data in the Internet community.


  DREP's vision:

  - Build an infrastructure to accelerate internet platformsâ€™ (social networking, online content providers,
  online games) user growth and traffic monetization

  - Tackle the issues of fake news/contents/accounts identification and filtering

  - Enhance tokenomics based on reputation-backed assets and reputation-backed currency

  - Establish token holders sharing pool for more targeted user acquisition
