  PokerSports is a platform that offers a variety of different fantasy sports games that are tailored
  to each one of our user's personal interests. Our games require skill, strategy and social interaction
  to give our users an experience never seen before in this industry. Through the integration of the iGaming
  and eSports markets, we are looking to revolutionize the way fantasy sports are played today.

  With the introduction of the PokerSports Token (XPST), PokerSports users from all over the world will
  be able to use a unique decentralized digital currency to play all available games, making for quick
  and easy transactions under a trustless system.
