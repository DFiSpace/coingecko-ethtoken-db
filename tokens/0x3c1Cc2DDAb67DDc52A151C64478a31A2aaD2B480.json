The ETB token  is an ERC-20 standard-based Ethereum token. We issued a fixed amount of 500,000 ETB  tokens (ERC-20 token with 8 decimal places). Every time ETB is transferred, 2% of the  transaction is destroyed. That means the recipient will only get 98% of the total transactions,  so each transaction made will reduce global supply.\nEvery ETB token destroyed is a deflationary measure helping to increase the token value  and retain the confidence of the token holders. When reduces the supply of a ETB token,  makes it's value raise. Destroying tokens then make the remaining ones very valuable. No  new tokens will be created or mined.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"etherburn","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9718/large/Webp-net-resizeimage.png?1571262911","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9718/small/Webp-net-resizeimage.png?1571262911","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9718/thumb/Webp-net-resizeimage.png?1571262911"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x3c1cc2ddab67ddc52a151c64478a31a2aad2b480"],"chat_url":["https://www.instagram.com/ether_burn/"],"facebook_username":"burnether","homepage":["https://etherburn.net/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"EtherBurn","twitter_screen_name":"Etherburn_ETB"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Etherburn","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"etb","tickers":[{"base":"ETB","market":{"identifier":"bamboo_relay","name":"Bamboo Relay"},"target":"WETH"}]}
