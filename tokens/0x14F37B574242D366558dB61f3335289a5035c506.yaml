  Hacker Gold (HKG) is the official token of the Virtual Accelerator. Itâ€™s the fuel that makes the platform
  possible. The sale started on 20 October 2016. The goal for many teams in the VA is to create their
  own startup. The platform makes this possible by allowing teams to issue their own tokens which can
  be bought solely for HKG during the event period. For fans, this is the chance to get in at the early
  stage, invest in a team and gain preferred voting rights on how funds are used. Startup tokens issued
  after the hackathon do not come voting rights. HKG is also an investment in the future success of the
  platform. HKG will be issued only once. Once the crowdsale is over, to participate in future Virtual
  Accelerator hackathons, HKG must be purchased on the open market.
