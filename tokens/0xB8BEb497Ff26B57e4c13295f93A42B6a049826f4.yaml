  Creation of a digital currency accepted by independent craft breweries in exchange for beer. Funds raised
  from issuing the tokens are invested into new and expanding craft breweries, increasing demand for the
  currency and providing a return to the Craft Coin Company Ltd.

  via the holders' smart phone. A coin is always underwritten by at least one pint of beer.
