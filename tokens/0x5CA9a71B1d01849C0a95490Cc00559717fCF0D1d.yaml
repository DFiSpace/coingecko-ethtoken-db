  Founded in 2017, Aeternity is a new, scalable, cryptocurrency platform that aims to improve cryptocurrencies,
  in general, by solving some of the most serious problems: scalability and security. Eliminating inefficiencies
  in the cryptomarket, increasing scalability of smart contacts and dapps, sharding, and moving contract
  execution off-chain are just some of the things that make Aeternity stand out from the crowd. Aeternity
  powers Turing-complete smart contracts that allow the execution of credible transactions without third
  parties and intermediaries. It has state channels to make it possible to execute smart contracts off-chain.
  The blockchain enforces the smart contract code, only in the case of a disagreement between the contracting
  parties.


  Its benefits are for example, high privacy. For many business applications it's crucial to have transactions
  which are not recorded in public. Smart contracts executed in state channels touch the blockchain only
  in the case of disagreement, acting like a self-arbitrating crypto court. It has high security too.
  For example, state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures and unparalleled decentralization provide
  robust efficiency and eliminate ""single point of failure"" (SPOF) issues. The cost of buying it very
  low too. By leveraging state channels as the default way to run smart contracts, Ã¦ternity becomes the
  most efficient Turing-complete blockchain and thus enables new forms of commerce via its low cost transactions.


  Aeternity is available on most major exchanges, where it can be traded with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>. As an ERC-20 token, Aeternity token
