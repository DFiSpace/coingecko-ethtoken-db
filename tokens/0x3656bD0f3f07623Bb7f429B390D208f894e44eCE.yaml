description: "INFLIV aim to provide a fast and secured trading experience to our customers in   BTC, ETH,\
  \ USDT and IFV trading options. Infliv prioritizes security of funds and user information by requiring\
  \ users to enable 2FA using Google Authenticator, or a U2F Security Key. To protect security of funds,\
  \ majority of system funds are stored in cold wallets and only approx. 0.5% of crypto assets are accessible\
  \ in hot wallets for day-to-day platform operations.\n\t\nThe Infliv Token (IFV) is built with ERC20\
  \ token based on Ethereum blockchain technology. This technology brings scalability and security to\
  \ users, and will soon reach the market with the prospect of revolutionizing the definition of exchanges.\
  \ Token holders will be granted exclusive benefits such as progressive discounts on the monthly subscription\
  \ fees. This is in addition to the highest quality service and speed when approving user deposits and\
  \ withdrawals. Infliv (IFV) supports all the Ethereum wallets."
