  Remiit is a decentralized remittance and payment platform that aims to act as a catalyst of globalization
  through the blockchain.

  REMIIT will create the current payment and remittance systems faster and more transparent while allowing
  money transfer operators (MTOs) and financial institutions build a cross-boarder remittance community
  with trust and reputation.


  REMIIT intends to innovate the business of ""what happens when we send and receive something"" from
  a new perspective. This is where REMIIT's own Ecosystem based on blockchain technology comes into place.


  At the heart of the overseas remittances/payment, there lies the foreign exchange for remittance process.
  REMIIT has designed the REMIIT *Smart Contract (RSC) to make the process to scale efficiently. Each
  participant in the REMIIT Ecosystem are placed at the center of the business relationship. To do this,
  the REMIIT Smart Contract (RSC) with the REMIIT Payment Gateway Protocol (RPGP) have combined to expand
  to ""payment"" through the remittance platform.


  With this infrastructure of these ecosystems, each participant can create a variety of channels to overcome
  existing problems. Ultimately, the limitations of the previous foreign exchange ecosystem will be overcome
  by various channels, the market will expand, and the business will grow.
