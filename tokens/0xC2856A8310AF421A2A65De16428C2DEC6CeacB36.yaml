description: >-
  Every month we will send the equivalence of TEN THOUSAND YAH to a non-profit organization aimed at the
  betterment of Jamaica in any shape or form. As a holder of YAH you determine which charity. And by holding
  it, you are protected against the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar, which lost more than 60% of its
  value against the US dollar in recent years.
