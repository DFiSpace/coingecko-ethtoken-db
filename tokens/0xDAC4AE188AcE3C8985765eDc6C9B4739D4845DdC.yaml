  InterValue aims to solve the problems such as low applicability, transaction congestion, high commissions,
  long con∆ârmation latency, weak resistance to quantum attacks, poor anonymity in communication and transaction,
  incapability in crossing and merging chains, large space for storage and etc. InterValue would optimize
  and improve Blockchain technology in all aspects including protocols and mechanisms, and become a genuine
  infrastructure of Blockchain 4.0. Also, InterValue would provide a platform for developing various DApps
  (distributed Apps), as well as feasible solutions to construct a global value-internet.
