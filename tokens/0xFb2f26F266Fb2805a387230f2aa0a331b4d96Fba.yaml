  DADI stands for Decentralized Architecture for a Democratic Internet. It’s a cryptocurrency which aims
  to decentralize cloud computing and Web Services. It’s an enterprise-grade web services stack built
  on an architecture containing many different “micro-services”. It uses a decentralized, cost-effective
  cloud computing system organized by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, with no single authority
  holding the monopoly for computing resource distribution.


  The DADI team consists of 18 full-time members, with engineers, strategic team members and designers,
  boasting of over 300 years of experience put together. Joseph Denne, the founder and CEO, is an expert
  in multi-agent and blockchain tech, as well as a pioneer in big data and machine learning, with over
  20 years of experience developing data and content platforms. The co-founder and key architect behind
  DADI’s decentralized business strategy, Chris Mair is no less qualified, being head of the strategy
  in Airlock and Diesel before DADI. The Technical Director James Lambie was previously Lead Developer
  for BBC Worldwide and Barclays Bank before that.


  DADI is on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> blockchain, so any
  wallet that supports Ethereum would be compatible with storing DADI tokens. This also means that no
  DADI mining is supported. A hardware DADI wallet will be the most secure, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-an-ethereum-wallet">Ledger
  Nano S</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en">Trezor</a>
  work for Ethereum, and so by default, for DADI.


  Exodus and Mist are desktop wallets which support the Ethereum blockchain, compatible with Windows,
  Linux and Mac.

  Jaxx is a versatile wallet, compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, iOS and Android smartphones,
  and Chrome and Firefox web extensions. MyEtherWallet is its most popular Web wallet, and ETHAdress is
  one of the paper wallets.
