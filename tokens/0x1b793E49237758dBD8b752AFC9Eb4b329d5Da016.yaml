  VITE - A Next Generation High-performance Decentralized Application Platform


  DAG Ledger

  Transactions in Vite are grouped by accounts. That is, each transaction only changes the state of one
  single account. Send transactions are separated from receive transactions, thereby obviating the need
  to wait for a transfer to be complete before the initiation of another transaction. The hierarchical
  design of the consensus algorithm allows horizontal scalability in consensus groups.


  Asynchronous Architecture

  Vite splits transactions into transaction pairs according to a "request-response" pattern. The writing
  and verification of transactions are asynchronously decoupled, thereby supporting ultra-high throughput.
  Inter-contract communications are based on an asynchronous messaging model.


  Reactive Contract

  Message-Driven

  With an event-driven architecture, every smart contract is viewed as an independent service. Contracts
  communicate via messages without sharing state.


  Solidity++

  Solidity++â€™s syntax is compatible with most of that of Solidity. The new syntax supports asynchronous
  semantics, contract scheduling, and provides a series of standard libraries, such as string manipulation,
  floating-point operations, basic mathematical operations, containers, sorting, and so on.


  Integrated Decentralized Ecosystem

  End-to-end system for value transfer

  Vite itself is a decentralized exchange that supports digital asset issuance, cross-chain value transmission,
  and inter-token transactions based on the Loopring protocol. A quota-based resource allocation mechanism
  allows light users to pay zero fees and gas. Users can obtain computing resources in multiple ways.
  Vite also supports quota leasing.


  dApp Mini Programs

  The Vite client features an engine for creating HTML5-based decentralized mini programs. This engine
  simplifies the process of dApp development and deployment.
