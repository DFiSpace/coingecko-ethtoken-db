  ParkinGO is a mobility platform that aggregates and facilitates the travel experience for millions of
  customers, private and corporate, the fragmentation of the customer base allows that our most important
  client generates less than 2% of the turnover.


  Established in 1995 as a response to the need for parking areas at Milano Malpensa airport, ParkinGO
  has grown its network in the European marketplace through a consolidation of affiliated off-airport
  locations offering a range of services that assure a positive and well-organized travel experience.
