  The OMG network is a scaling solution for finance on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>,
  enabling transparent, peer-to-peer transactions in real-time. The decentralized network facilitates
  self-sovereign financial services across geographies, asset classes and applications. OmiseGo builds
  an app with our SDK to enable wallet-to-wallet transactions of crypto and fiat currencies, loyalty points,
  game credits and more. It uses the OMG network to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that
  are kept securely on chain. Besides, it offers a decentralized exchange mechanism to provide multi-asset
  and cross-chain interoperability, that is scalable and secure via <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Proof+of+Stake&view=market">proof-of-stake</a>.


  OmiseGO is building a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=9&view=market">decentralized
  exchange</a>, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain
  gateway. OmiseGO is not owned by any single one party. Instead, it is an open distributed network of
  validators which enforce behavior of all participants. It uses the mechanism of a protocol token to
  create a proof-of-stake blockchain to enable enforcement of market activity amongst participants. This
  high-performant distributed network enforces exchange across asset classes, from fiat-backed issuers
  to fully decentralized blockchain tokens (ERC-20 style and native cryptocurrencies).


  Unlike nearly all other decentralized exchange platforms, this allows for decentralized exchange of
  other blockchains and between multiple blockchains directly without a trusted gateway token. Markets
  may be able to significantly reduce spreads and encourage market assurance via decentralizing custody
  and increased transparency of market activity. This is achieved using smart contracts, protocol tokens
  enforcing correct market behavior of orderbook matching, a new construction of Ethereum bonded external
  enforcement of clearinghouse activity, and commitments to historical exchange data for use with Ethereum
  smart contracts.


  There are several benefits such as access. Through the open source, white-label SDK, digital wallet
  providers can connect to the public OMG network to enable users to transact any digital assets, including
  crypto and fiat currencies. It has high security because bonding to the Ethereum blockchain creates
  secure token custody, decentralized exchange of all Ethereum assets, and ultra-secure transaction validation.
  It is very stable as the Plasma architecture allows for unlimited scalability with unprecedented transaction
  speed: millions, and potentially billions of transactions per second.


  OmiseGO allows for stakeholders, from individuals to issuers, to have significantly greater assurance
  in the financial mechanisms of society. With the emerging popularity of eWallet platforms, siloed networks
  are becoming a problem. This creates a unique opportunity for fiat tokens to interchange across a decentralized
  network, along with cross compatibility with cryptocurrencies. In order to build this decentralized
  interchange network, it requires not only a blockchain well-suited for payments and interchange of issued
  tokens, but also a decentralized exchange which supports these activities, as well as incentives around
  creating well-functioning liquidity pools.


  Eventually, these issued tokens may asymptotically get closer and closer to full decentralization (including
  user-owned keys) which maximizes agency of the individual. This can be achieved by creating not only
  transparency in the business process of payment interchange, but also removing the ownership of the
  business process itself from a single trusted entity.


  The OmiseGo team has already been recognized as up and coming “Fintech Rockstars” by Forbes for their
  contributions to date. Omise contributed $100,000 in funding to the Ethereum foundation’s DEVGRANTS
  which is a program to help new Ethereum focused projects, develop the code bases and implement community
  evangelism. This indicates their commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.This has helped them
  amass a fairly stacked advisory board. The OmiseGO board lists the co-founders of Ethereum, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem">Golem</a>,
  Tendermint, Cosmos and even the Lightning Network as advisors. That’s quite a justice league of crypto-superstars.


  Although many cryptos are focused on disrupting global banking, Omise and OmiseGO are actually following
  current trends in the banking industry. Their goal is to provide banking to the unbanked, something
  both PayPal and Stripe are also doing in a similar manner.
