  The SDUSD token is issued by <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alchemint-standards">Alchemint’s</a>
  smart contract and is designed to hold $1 USD worth of value by locking NEO as collateral. The SDUSD
  token is the first native stablecoin to the NEO blockchain.


  On December 17th, 2018, Alchemint launched its SDUSD stable coin issuance platform to the NEO MainNet.
  The stablecoin distribution platform aims to mortgage digital assets through smart contracts and manage
  collateral risk. Eventually, Alchemint aims to anchor a stablecoin to any assets, which may include
  fiat currency, cryptocurrency, and other commodities.


  Alchemint seeks to differentiate itself from other stable coin projects in the frequency of its audit
  reports. Users will be able to audit the stable coins at any time using the blockchain explorer.


  SDUSD is the first digital asset to be launched through Alchemint’s SAR-C smart contract and is pegged
  to the US dollar. SDUSD was selected as the US dollar is the largest liquid currency, but Alchemint
  aims to gradually anchor other assets in the SAR-C model.


  Stable Foundation isn’t the only entity that can liquidate SARs to maintain a high collateral rate.
  Users can also liquidate SARs that have a collateral rate of 149% or lower. To liquidate, the individual
  uses SDUSD to purchase the SAR at a 10% discount (compared to market value). This way, users help individual
  SARs maintain their collateral rate of 150% or more.
