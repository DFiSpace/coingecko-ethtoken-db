description: >-
  Coinvest is the worldâ€™s first decentralized stock market for cryptocurrencies. Coinvest empowers anyone
  to virtually invest in individual or a curated index of cryptonized assets through one coin. Coinvest
  is creating a future where users have one platform, one wallet, and one token (COIN), that enables anyone
  to create a digital investment portfolio to invest in multiple cryptocurrencies. Thereby reducing the
  cost, risk, and complexity associated with investing in cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges or
  investment funds. Centralized third parties that are often needed in traditional investment use cases
  are replaced with smart contracts that act as autonomous agents and programmatically compensate all
  users, investors, and owners within the entire Coinvest ecosystem
