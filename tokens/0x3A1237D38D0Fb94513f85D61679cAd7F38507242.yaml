  Mindexcoin (MIC) is a token that enables data operations in the Ethereum Decentralized Network. Created
  in December 2017, in its ICO phase, the currency was sold for $0.25 and today has already reached more
  than $20. This growth of 8,000% is due to the incentives that the company has been giving to the success
  of the currency, such as the Mindexcoin Airdrop.


  Mindexcoin is currently listed in various ICO directories around the world, such as Coinist and Cryptoslate.
  This shows that MIC is growing and continues to strengthen partnerships.
