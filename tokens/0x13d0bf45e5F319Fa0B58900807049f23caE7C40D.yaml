  READ is a blockchain based publishing and reading platform which connect writers directly with their
  readers with the need of publishers or any reselling agency. ReaderNet allows writers to write, edit,
  publish and showcase their book directly to readers instead of taking the path which is being followed
  for centuries now. Readers can buy or rent these books directly from writers buy paying them using READ
  tokens. Writers save on hefty cuts taken by publishers & listing websites like Amazon, Safari, Bookstore
  etc.
