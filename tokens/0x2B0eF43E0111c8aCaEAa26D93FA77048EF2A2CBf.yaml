description: >-
  The Decenternet(a.k.a. Dnet) is an alternative P2P permanent hyperspeed neutral decentralized internet
  infrastructure platform solution unbound by politics and oppression. Once Dnet is out, it canâ€™t be stopped
  from spreading. It is cheaper, much faster, proliferates net neutrality, protects your privacy and removes
  the influence of corrupt intermediaries without having to ask for permission from any central organization.
  Decenternet core assets such as Dnet web hosting, the blockchain native Spyce, Liberty Search Engine,
  and the Osiris Net-Neutral Web Browser create a completely free web environment which delivers profits
  directly to the participating peers without the exploitation of an intermediary.
