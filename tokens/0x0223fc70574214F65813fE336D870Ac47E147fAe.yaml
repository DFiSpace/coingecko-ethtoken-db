  Reforging The Cornerstone Of The Blockchain World

  CanonChain will be triggered from the protocol layer and the chipset layer of data communications to
  provide a robust foundation for the entire blockchain industry.


  The pursuit of inclusiveness and relative fairness is the target of CanonChain.


  CanonChain will be triggered from the protocol layer and the chip layer of the communication to provide
  a robust foundation for the entire blockchain industry.


  UNDERLYING PROTOCOL

  We have established the basic protocol for the Fog Networking and implemented a new consensus mechanism
  via a specially designed blockchain chipset that truly fulfill the transactional capability requirements
  of dApps at the chip-level


  BUCKYBALL (FULLERENE) NETWORK

  Our Buckyball topology architecture will support the decentralized characteristics of DeOSes (Decentralized
  Operating Systems) and Dapps (Decentralized Applications) operations, by reaching consensus on fragmented
  self-autonomous network.


  VALUE SYSTEM BASED ON PARTICIPATION

  Operating on the main chain and application chain of CanonChain. When the blockchain and network resources
  are being contributed or used in different levels of applications and blockchain nodes, a standard measure
  is required, which is known as Xuanchi CZR.
