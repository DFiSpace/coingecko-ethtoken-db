description: >-
  Volatility is great for traders and exchanges, and volatility in cryptoassets has driven huge growth
  for all trading platforms over the past year. This growth has created a need for scalable and stable
  cryptoassets for both traders and exchanges to trade against. Existing solutions involve significant
  centralization or have struggled to scale to meet demand. Havven solves both of these issues through
  the creation of a decentralized payment network. A stablecoin that scales while avoiding the risks of
  centralized off-chain assets will be a huge benefit for the entire trading ecosystem. It will provide
  fast interexchange settlement, stable trading against ERC-20 assets, and a safe place to park value
  without the need to settle into fiat. Havven has made significant progress in deploying our network
  since the completion of the token sale (the largest in Australia at USD$30m) in February 2018. The network
  is built on the Ethereum blockchain and it employs two tokens, both of which are ERC20 compatible. The
  Havven network has been released as an open source protocol so that anyone can integrate with it, including
  exchanges and decentralised platforms.
