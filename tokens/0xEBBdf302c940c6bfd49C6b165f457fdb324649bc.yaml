  Hydro enables new and existing private systems to seamlessly integrate and leverage the immutable &
  transparent dynamics of a public blockchain to enhance application and document security, identity management,
  transactions, and artificial intelligence.


  Hydro enables developers to seamlessly deploy blockchain in their existing applications, without the
  need to create expensive infrastructure. If you are building a fintech app in investing, savings, or
  insurance, Hydrogen is already leveraging the Hydro blockchain technology. Through the Hydrogen API,
  you can build a blockchain application without being a blockchain developer.


  The proposed technology is called “Raindrop” - a transaction performed through a smart contract that
  validates private system access publicly, and can complement existing private authentication methods.
  The technology is intended to provide additional security for sensitive financial data that is increasingly
  at risk from hacking and breaches. Initial implementation of the Hydro Raindrop is performed on the
  Hydrogen API Platform. This modular set of APIs is available to enterprises and developers globally
  to prototype, build, test, and deploy sophisticated financial technology platforms and products.


  The Hydro Raindrop will be made available to the world developer community as open source software,
  to allow developers to integrate the Hydro Raindrop with any REST API.
