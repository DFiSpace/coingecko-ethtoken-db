Mycion does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized 2 applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"mycion","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8981/large/myc.PNG?1563420117","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8981/small/myc.PNG?1563420117","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8981/thumb/myc.PNG?1563420117"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1ac9eb7cddabfd9e5ca49c23bd521afcdf8be49"],"homepage":["http://www.mycion.cc/"]},"liquidity_score":15.864,"market_cap_rank":5057,"name":"Mycion","public_interest_score":30.783,"symbol":"myc","tickers":[]}
