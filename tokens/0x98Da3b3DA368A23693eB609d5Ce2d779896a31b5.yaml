  INSEE is an accessible, decentralized and transparent platform, where nodes are not only users, but
  also co-creators and shareholders of visual contents. The contribution of nodes will be recorded and
  tokenized on blockchain, thereby, creating an ecosystem of engaging content co-creation and efficient
