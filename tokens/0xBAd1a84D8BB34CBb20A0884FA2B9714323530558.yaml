  Lamoneda aims to service key markets that are underrepresented by current platforms.


  We bring you the ability to establish new markets that won't necessarily compete with the ticketing
  industry but will eventually, in the near future, with the Moneda protocol eclipse all other ticket
  providers in the industry.


  Although we will be working with artists, event organizers and promoters, we will not rely on them 100%
  to generate revenue/activity or to sell our tokens. We will also be participating in the secondary markets
  by buying into big name events and reselling it @ not more than 20 % mark up.
