Melon is one such platform that works through a blockchain protocol allowing easy and efficient maintenance of cryptocurrencies. Acting as a hedge fund, Melon presents a fully customizable administration of your digital assets. You can use it as an online vault that allows you to store and transact your funds through its web portal. Melon was developed to meet the need for a cost-efficient and technologically advanced hedge fund to manage digital assets. Reto Trinkler and Mona El Isa founded the company, Melonport AG in July 2016.\n\nThe company created Melon as a digital asset management protocol. It is a first of its kind system that enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network. Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across multiple <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> networks to provide better efficiency and security for the assets. With the Melon protocol, users can save both time and money for investing in a hedge fund. Additionally, there is no requirement of a third party approval from a lawyer or advisor.\n\nMelon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/melon\">ICO</a> was launched in February 2017 and sold out within 10 minutes. Melonport is aiming to bridge the gap between the portfolio managers and the investors by removing the role of the third parties such as law firms. Melonport\u2019s CEO, Mona El Isa comes from a strong financial background and is versed with the problems of the investment industry.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to be done on the Melon project, even though things are looking quite positive already. An audit of the protocol has been completed already, and the project continues to advance. No further specifics have been provided on the website, although it remains to be seen what the future holds. Bringing more value to Melon Coin would be a good idea, yet it remains to be seen how that might be achieved.","developer_score":63.297,"id":"melon","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/605/large/melon.png?1547034295","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/605/small/melon.png?1547034295","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/605/thumb/melon.png?1547034295"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1763204,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892","https://etherscan.io/token/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xec67005c4E498Ec7f55E092bd1d35cbC47C91892"],"facebook_username":"melonport","homepage":["https://melonport.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/melonproject/protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/melonproject","telegram_channel_identifier":"melonport","twitter_screen_name":"melonport"},"liquidity_score":6.996,"market_cap_rank":600,"name":"Melon","public_interest_score":36.563,"symbol":"mln","tickers":[{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MLN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"}]}
