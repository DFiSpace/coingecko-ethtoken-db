description: >-
  Cryptocurrencies and crypto payment solutions can be natively accepted on conventional, mainstream,
  existing payment networks, and become less dependent upon issuers. This also reduces the burden to merchants
  of dealing with multiple networks, interfaces and management/reconciliation systems by having a single,
  consolidated front-end system.
