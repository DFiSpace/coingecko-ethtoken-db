  PUNCH is a global collaborative creation network, a public blockchain with six complete layers. Upholding
  the idea of freedom in creative work, PUNCH creates an integral service system covering everything from
  resource matching, creation incubation, distributed collaboration organization to production and commercial
  operation of works, redefining the ecological system of cultural and creative industries and brings
  about a disruptive reform. The ultimate objective of PUNCH is to become an creative eco-network integrated
  together with the distributed collaborative organization (DCO), the blockchain application API and the
  work flow for copyright confirmation and exchange collaboration.https://punch.network/
