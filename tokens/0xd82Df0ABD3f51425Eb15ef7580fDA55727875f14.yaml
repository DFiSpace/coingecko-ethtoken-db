  DAV is an open source software platform that allows anyone to buy or sell autonomous transportation
  services in a decentralized market. DAV integrates into any autonomous vehicle (car, drone, ship), enabling
  those vehicles to discover, communicate, and transact with one another using a digital currency called
  the DAV token. This shapes a decentralized manned transportation network today and is the underlying
  infrastructure for an autonomous transportation network tomorrow. DAV will be a protocol that connects
  vehicles and users, which indeed enables a decentralized transportation market, aimed both at people
  and vehicle companies, and the Team is already in advanced discussions with companies in the fields
  of drones, robotics, and automotive.
