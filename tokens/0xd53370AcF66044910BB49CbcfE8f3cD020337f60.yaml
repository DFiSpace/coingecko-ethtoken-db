  Consensus is the open-sourced, decentralized artificial intelligence platform, powered by native cryptocurrency,
  and built with the vision to improve the governance mechanisms at all levels of organizational structures:
  community, startup, non-profit, enterprise, city, county or the entire country. Once fully realized,
  Consensus AI will be able to offer automated, data-driven solutions to the most complex problems of
  our collective co-existence by modelling the potential outcomes of proposed changes. Consensus will
  help govern communities, societies and countries in a more cost efficient, transparent and progressive
  manner. This will be implemented via collective voting, initiatives proposal and funding, execution
  reporting and intelligent algorithms that will perform project analysis and model the outcomes with
  the efficiency, budgetary concerns, social, environmental and other factors under consideration.


  Mission

  The mission of Consensus is to achieve collective governance based on interdependence using advanced
  technologies.


  Abstract

  There are three main components to the Consensus system: the Sentient blockchain network built with
  verified nodes that allows running distributed machine learning, the Research Platform with extended
  data collection and modelling capabilities and the AI Advisor â€” a standalone system constantly monitoring
  and learning from the incoming available data that is used to make predictions. Later stages of development
  will include internally and externally built Dapps for various governance applications.
