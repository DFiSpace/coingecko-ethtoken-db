  SOLAREUM was founded with a key, essential, but-simple proposition: to connect the world with renewable
  resources at the touch of a button.


  SOLAREUM’S core mission is to ensure that it is today’s “Amazon of Renewables” for individual and corporate
  consumers alike–and with a guest presentation at the United Nations Youth Assembly this past February
  from our CEO, Kenneth Reece, SOLAREUM has also proven its commitment to tomorrow.
