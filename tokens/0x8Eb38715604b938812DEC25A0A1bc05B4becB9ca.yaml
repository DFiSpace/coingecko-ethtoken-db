  increase agricultural output globally with the major focus on Africa.


  The Gric Coin Project is in 3 parts.


  1. The farm and Blockchain Project

  2. The Gric Coin Utility Project

  3. The service adoption project.


  The Farm and Blockchain Project involve us purchasing and setting up a 1000 acres farm with processing
  and packaging industry to process and package items to the standard we need for our Blockchain website
  for product verification, authentication and reduction of food fraud.


  The Gric Coin Utility Project also known as farm partner Project is an upcoming platform where investors
  will use Gric Coin to pay for investment in real live Agricultural Project and earn returns on their
  investment. www.farmpartner.ng


  The service adoption project is the last part of the project where we allow other Agricultural business
  to adopt the service and standard we have created as a benchmark for their own project.
