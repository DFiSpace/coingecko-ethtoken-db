Hashpower will base on the technical characteristic to build a decentralized hash power resource shared platform which is open, fair, transparent and covenant-lite for users and provide better service connected with rich industry experience for global users at the same time. Based on the hash power system with open source and its own mining infrastructure, hash power Coin has provided node users around the world with mine construction, power lease, mine operation, equipment procurement, computational investment, digital asset trading, circulation, exchange and other services.\n\nBy reducing the mining costs, such as the use of big data, cloud mining, CDN network of the entire network of computer room networks, hash power contract mechanism, the more nation-wide mining services based on HPC digital assets has been constructed. The basic logic is as follows:\n\n1. Low-cost electricity power resources control is uesd to ensure steady earnings of project investment.\nCurrently, mining digital currencies in blockchain requires a lot of resources, especially electric power resources. Too much consumption has caused policy makers in many countries to take drastic measures against mining. Hash power Coin estimated the electric power cost of many countries, and finally selected the United States, Russia, and Sweden as the preferred overseas layout countries, and guaranteed steady earnings of project investment by controlling low-cost electric power resource channels.\n\n2. Layout in multiple countries to avoid policy risks of single country\nBlockchain as an emerging technology, each country has invested a lot of enthusiasm to the blockchain, however, different countries have shown different attitudes to the digital currency of the blockchain and formulated different policies, both of which are unstable. Hash power Coin took into account the legal risks involved and adopted a multinational development strategy to avoid the risk of project termination arising from a country\u2019s policies. We have 3 million square meters of factory buildings to transform and build the machine room in Russia, and have met the indicators of natural gas power generation, so we can generate electricity for own use with 1.4 million kilowatts, the power plant now has 300,000 kilowatts of natural gas.\n\n3. Multi-modal mining investment combines POW hash power layout with POS node layout\nAt present, there are two mining modes\u2014POW hash power layout and POS node layout. POW algorithm is proof of work algorithm. The proof of work is from the economics, which is an effective economic strategy proposed by two economists firstly in 1993 to prevent the abuse of services or resources. This type of hash power layout method rewards miners based on their contribution to mining, while the latter, POS node. layout is a model generates a new digital asset for the node based on the amount and time of the digital asset that the node holds. Hash power Coin provides mining services with ASIC, GPU, CPU, lPFS, and CDN bandwidth mining. Users can independently select the mining model through the hash power Coin. At the same time, hash power Coin plans to lay out ETH nodes in advance and will provide users with ETH-to-POS services in the future.\n\n4.Network of core labs\nHash power Coin adopts the network of core labs. Local cache acceleration is set up in different regions, which improves the access speed of different nodes and greatly improves the stability of the above mining nodes. Anti-attack cluster, with widely distributed CDN nodes and intelligent redundancy mechanisms between nodes, effectively prevents hackers from invading and reduces the impact of various D.D.o.S attacks\non websites, while ensuring better service quality.\n\n5. Computing power trading platform docking the main mining pool and mine field.\nHash power Coin solves the practical problems of mining and opens up the road between ordinary users and high-quality mine fields, so that more ordinary users can enjoy the benefits of increased hash power. The hash power trading platform of hash power Coin is easy to operate and safe, enabling more people interested in the blockchain to participate in the global digital asset allocation and get diversified difital assets in return.\n\n6.Hash power contract\nWith the improvement of the blockchain of mainstream digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the mining power is becoming more and more concentrated, and the difficulty in mining is increasing. It is under this background that the hash power Coin came into being. Therefore, intuitively speaking, the hash power Coin is a cloud hash power contract for miners, especially small and medium-sized miners, or for those who lack the infrastructure for mining digital currency. The so- called cloud hash power contract is the transformation of traditional single node mining behavior into joint mining, it eliminates a series of tedious deployments of mining, the purchase of a force contract is equal to the purchase of computing power. Mining can be achieved quickly and easily, and holding a contract represents owning a share of cloud hash power in the entire project. Users can obtain the corresponding digital assets generated by mining in accordance with their own hash power contracts. In addition, through interchange of the HPC digital assets that are originally from hash power Coin, the participants can transfer or exchange contracts, and choose to participate in or withdraw from the project according to the voluntary principle.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"hash-power-capital","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4958/large/hash-power-capital-logo.png?1547040380","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4958/small/hash-power-capital-logo.png?1547040380","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4958/thumb/hash-power-capital-logo.png?1547040380"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@powerhash"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a0c31837edb132a9312841b9527e6307db13509","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1a0c31837edb132a9312841b9527e6307db13509"],"facebook_username":"power.hash.5","homepage":["http://hashpower.vip"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"HashPowerVip","twitter_screen_name":"power_hash"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":3647,"name":"Hash Power Capital","public_interest_score":39.394,"symbol":"hpc","tickers":[]}
