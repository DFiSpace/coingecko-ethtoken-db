  Carbon Grid Protocol: bridging blockchain networks with the carbon credits market

  Carbon Grid Protocol (CGRID) is designed as a complementary protocol layer enabling blockchain networks
  & DApps to efficiently access carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint. Our CGRID token dynamics
  will also provide compelling economic incentives for market participants to achieve and maintain carbon
  neutrality. Our ultimate goal is to promote the widespread adoption of carbon credits in blockchain
  as a valuable and readily tradable asset class.
