description: >-
  Cartesi is a layer-2 infrastructure, which aims to enable complex and intensive computations to run
  in a Linux environment, outside the blockchain, without compromising decentralization.

  Developers can work in a familiar environment with no artificial limitations and with access to their
  favorite tools.

  dApps can store data temporarily on the Cartesi Side Chain, which is governed by a Proof-of-Stake consensus
  algorithm, without having to constantly communicate with the layer-1 blockchain.

  Raised 0.80 MM USD via private token sales from August 2017 to December 2019.


  Cartesi is building an operating system for dApps. The project enables complex and intensive computations
  run in a Linux environment, outside the blockchain, without compromising decentralization. Cartesi aims
  to make dApps significantly more powerful, cost-effective, easier to develop, and portable. The goal
  is to bring mainstream productivity to developers and a satisfying experience for users.
