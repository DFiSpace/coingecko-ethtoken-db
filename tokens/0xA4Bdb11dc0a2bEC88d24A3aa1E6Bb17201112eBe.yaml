description: >-
  StableUSD (USDS) is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin created by Stably, Inc. Each StableUSD token is
  legally backed and redeemable for a US Dollar held in FDIC-insured escrow accounts managed by our fiduciary
  custodians, such as Prime Trust.


  The biggest and most obvious problem with using popular cryptocurrencies for transactional purposes
  at the moment is price volatility. By making StableUSD redeemable and pegged 1-to-1 with US dollars,
  we can virtually eliminate volatility while still retaining many useful characteristics of a cryptocurrency
  - including fast transaction speed, anonymity, and immutability.
