  LOT allows you to use the expanded set of services of the platform and application.

  This utility token is used to reduce transactions fees and get special bonuses. LOT allows taking part
  in loyalty programs as well.

  Our team is always working on expanding the implementation of the token in order to make it more useful
  and liquid.

  Currently, part of the tokens was distributed among private investors and reserved for operational needs.
  The LOT tokens distributed during the whole period of the platform operation and are used inside the
  ecosystem.
