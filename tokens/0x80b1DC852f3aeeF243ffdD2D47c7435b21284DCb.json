This allows for the token to act as a store of value and be swiftly and easily sent from person to person using a tiny amount of ETH.\n\nMIASMA is a deflationary token. Each transaction will pass on 99.9% of MIA to the receiver. 0.07% is burned forever, and 0.03% is sent to the dividend pool. This allows for MIASMA's supply to shrink overtime, meaning that the tokens will become scarce and therefore more valuable","developer_score":0.0,"id":"miasma","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9585/large/CX3QY2l.png?1569222583","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9585/small/CX3QY2l.png?1569222583","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9585/thumb/CX3QY2l.png?1569222583"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x80b1dc852f3aeef243ffdd2d47c7435b21284dcb"],"homepage":["https://kaydesmith.wixsite.com/miasmatoken"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"MiasmaAirdrop","twitter_screen_name":"MiasmaToken"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":3665,"name":"Miasma","public_interest_score":27.098,"symbol":"mia","tickers":[{"base":"MIA","market":{"identifier":"bamboo_relay","name":"Bamboo Relay"},"target":"WETH"}]}
