  Financial ecological chain refers to the living state of financial institutions and their interlocking
  relationship with the social environment. People often use "ecology" to define many beautiful things,
  such as health, beauty, harmony and other things can be described as "ecology". In the process of asset
  digitization, we hope to solve the problems of limited capacity of public chain, high transaction cost
  on the chain, user privacy and authenticity and consistency between digital assets and real assets through
  financial ecological chain. We hope that through financial chain, commercial blockchain will have unlimited
  capacity, basic free of charge and the ability to protect trade secrets. Different businesses and scenarios
  are connected together through technology to achieve efficient collaboration.
