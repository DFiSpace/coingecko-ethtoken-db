  HOURS CHAIN is a blockchain based on personal health data services. It aims to provide real and effective
  personal health data services for medical insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and medical
  institutions. With HOURS CHAIN, we can develop a personalized mobile application service (DAPP). We
  can also write our RTMLTS (RFID Technology in Medical Logistics Tracking System) code into the chip
  and implant the wearable device to keep abreast of personal health. The data is recorded directly on
  the individual’s electronic health ledger through our independently developed Data Analysis Module (DAM).HOURS
  CHAIN is created based on the characteristics of Ethereum with independent innovation as a healthy private
  chain of “enterprise and user dual level” services. It builds a BaaS-level architecture and infrastructure,
  opens internal capabilities and can be shared with businesses and government agencies. A blockchain
  ecology that forms a credible personal health record can promote the development of a trusted internet.
