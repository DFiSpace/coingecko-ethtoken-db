description: >-
  Reserve aims to build a stable, decentralized, asset-backed cryptocurrency and a digital payment system
  that scales supply with demand and maintains 100% or more collateral backing. Ultimately, Reserve’s
  goal is to create a universal store of value – particularly in regions with unreliable banking infrastructure
  and regions where hyperinflation is an issue. The Reserve system will interact with three kinds of tokens:


  (1) The Reserve token (RSV), which is a stable cryptocurrency that can be held and spent the way we
  use normal fiat money;


  (2) The Reserve Rights token (RSR), a protocol token used to facilitate the stability of RSV.


  (3) A growing variety of tokenized real-world assets (such as other stablecoins) that are held by the
  Reserve smart contract to back RSV.
