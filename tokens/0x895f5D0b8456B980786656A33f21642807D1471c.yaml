  blockhive provides its expertise in blockchain to support projects and companies that have the potential
  to benefit from decentralized technology. We have developed Initial Loan Procurement, a crowdfunding
  solution that enables creditors around the world to contribute to the projects they believe in and receive
  interest payments. A unique token has been created to make these loans tradable. The loan contracts
  and the tokens are both recorded on the blockchain.
