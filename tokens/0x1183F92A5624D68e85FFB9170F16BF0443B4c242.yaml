  Qvolta is a global P2P exchange platform that allows users to quickly and easily convert cryptocurrencies
  into the fiat currencies, and vice versa. We have created Qvolta as a direct response to a huge market
  problem that exists in the global cryptocurrencies market. In the majority of countries around the world
  individuals are not able to quickly (within 5-10 minutes) and conveniently convert cryptocurrencies
  into fiat money. While some exchange platforms are available, most lack the scale and offer unsophisticated
  tech solutions, that lack security and are challenging and complicated to use.
