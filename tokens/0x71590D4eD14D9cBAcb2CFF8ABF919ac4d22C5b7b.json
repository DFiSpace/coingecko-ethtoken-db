ASH was created in order to reward community members who were holding BURN at the ASH creation date.\n\nThe main BURN wallet matches the amount of BURN tokens that are removed from total supply, and sells BURN for ASH, thus adding ETH into the ASH/ETH pool. This ASH is then distributed daily to the one lucky heap (Top 512 ASH holder), who received 1% after the daily transaction.\n\nASH was minted with a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens. 1% is destroyed with every transaction, with a further 1% sent to one of the heap members.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"ash","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9434/large/ASHicon200.png?1567403856","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9434/small/ASHicon200.png?1567403856","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9434/thumb/ASHicon200.png?1567403856"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@TheBurnToken"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x71590d4ed14d9cbacb2cff8abf919ac4d22c5b7b"],"facebook_username":"TheBurnToken","homepage":["https://theburntoken.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"burntoken","twitter_screen_name":"BurnToken"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":6353,"name":"Ash","public_interest_score":35.196,"symbol":"ash","tickers":[{"base":"ASH","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"}]}
