description: >-
  AlphaNu is a platform and marketplace which facilitates subscriptions of powerful trading algorithms
  created by the top Wall Street developers. There is a large discrepancy in the growth of trading automation
  in China; only 5% of trading volume is executed by computers, compared to 85% for US equities and futures
  trading. In fact, retail traders comprise 85% of the Chinese futures market. Alphanu enables developers
  to monetize their algorithms by providing computer trading to a heavily underserved market. This enables
  investments into the growth of the computer trading market where access to rare, processed datasets
  from top Asian exchanges (commodities) are lacking.
