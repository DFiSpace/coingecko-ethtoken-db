  Hyperbridge, through its first product to market BlockHub is automating the inherently complex process
  of developing smarty contracts. We will allow game developers the ability to crowdfund their projects,
  without the friction (both time & cost) of a kickstarter campaign. While also enabling them to publish,
  market and sell their games in our decentralised digital distribution platform.
