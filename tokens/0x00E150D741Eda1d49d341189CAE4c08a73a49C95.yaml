  INF- The smart solution to never losing the password to your crypto wallet again INF is a blockchain-based
  storage application that allows users to encrypt and store a variety of alphanumeric data on a decentralized
  network. The user data is securely stored on a peer-to-peer network (IPFS) which also ensures that it
  is only accessible to the designated recipient upon a predetermined inactivity trigger. Examples of
  user data that can be stored in our secured environment are: passwords, wallet files, private keys,
  JSON files, UTC files, keystore files, mnemonic phrases, recovery seeds and even short text messages.
