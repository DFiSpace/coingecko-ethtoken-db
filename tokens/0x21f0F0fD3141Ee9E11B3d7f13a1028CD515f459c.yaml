  MoneyRebel is a financial platform that acts as a marketplace. It brings together crypto-skilled advisors
  and newcomers who want to explore the world of crypto. Ratings of advisors are maintained on blockchain
  which eliminates the problem of trust between counterparties. Platform is designed like a set of independent
  but connected products. Interconnecting accounts, the MR Wallet, the MR Portfolio, the MR Advisor, the
  news feed, and the MR Kriptel.de fund, a crypto arbitrage product − these are the platform’s basic features.
  Put the MR Banking, the MR Robo Advisor, the MR Virtual Assistant, and the MR ICO Pooling on top of
  that, and you get a complete financial platform for the digital age.
