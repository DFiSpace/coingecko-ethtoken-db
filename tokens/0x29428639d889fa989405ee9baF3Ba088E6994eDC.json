The barrier of entry is fair and balanced for all participants.\n\nThe only rule of BASED is that no one can change the rules. There are no owners, and because the private keys have been burned, the contracts cannot be changed. This makes an exit scam impossible.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"based-money","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12115/large/Based.png?1597261198","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12115/small/Based.png?1597261198","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12115/thumb/Based.png?1597261198"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x29428639d889fa989405ee9baf3ba088e6994edc"],"homepage":["https://based.money/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/cryptoghoulz/based-contracts"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"basedmoney","twitter_screen_name":"BasedProtocol"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":553,"name":"Based Money","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"$based","tickers":[]}
