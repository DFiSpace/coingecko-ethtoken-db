  Vio is using Blockchain and Visa Direct to make it easier for people to transfer money from person to
  person anywhere in the world, introducing a new method of international money transfer. Across Africa,
  remittance solutions are typically among the most expensive in the world, with up to 20% being charged
  on a single transaction. With Vio, there are no transfer and exchange fees and no foreign exchange mark-up,
  solving for some of the biggest markets for these remittance corridors. Vio has certified with Visa
  to ensure exchange of funds when users want to cash out. By launching in 18 countries and enabling money
  transfer to millions of current Visa debit cardholders, Vio aims to become the “Ripple” of Africa.
