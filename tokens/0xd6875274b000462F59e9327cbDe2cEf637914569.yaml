  The QUSD token is a low-volatility coin meaning that it is never supposed to change significantly in
  value. This is thanks to coins always only being sold at a certain amount, which motivates buyers to
  not sell for less. Therefore, QUSD tokens are good for value preservation. The main difference between
  QUSD tokens and competitors such as USDT, is that QUSD is issued by a reputable company from a reputable
  family.


  Token use: QUSD will be used as a real-time, real-world, and crypto-world currency as well as for storing
  value.
