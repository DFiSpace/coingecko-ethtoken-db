It optimizes and innovates the underlying technology and architecture to support value transfer between different block chain networks. UENC classifies the process, builds a new consensus, and establishes an efficient node combination structure by reconstructing a DHT-based hybrid peer-to-peer network, thus speeding up the public chain transaction.","id":"universalenergychain","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xb3dd5dce850dca7519e74a943568b69f958df52c"],"homepage":["http://www.enchain.cc/"]},"name":"UniversalEnergyChain","symbol":"uenc","tickers":[]}
