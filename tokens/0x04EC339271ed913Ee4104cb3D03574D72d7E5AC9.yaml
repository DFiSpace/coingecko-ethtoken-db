  Gemstra is a blockchain-enabled ecosystem that powers Influencer / KOL Commerce - the fastest growing
  gig economy. Gemstra decentralizes and democratize the $10Bn USD Influencer / KOL commerce industry
  that is growing 20% year over year. Over 600 million Influencers / KOLs today drive an estimated $100Bn
  USD in consumer purchasing. Businesses (brands and merchants) enjoy 20-30% higher conversion rates and
  2-10x return when investing in Influencer / KOL marketing. Existing systems today are centralized and
  provide low transparency for businesses and little to no data back to Influencers/KOLs. Data is captive
  and transactions are limited and cumbersome. Gemstra’s infrastructure platform changes that. Gemstra’s
  native GEMS Token is payment and staking token for the Influencer/KOL economy. GEMS reduces friction,
  allows borderless transactions, and most importantly creates a governance model that promotes the commonwealth
  of Influencers/KOLs and Businesses (Brands and Merchants).
