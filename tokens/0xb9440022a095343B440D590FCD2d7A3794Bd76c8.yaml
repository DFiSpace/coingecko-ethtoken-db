description: >-
  Saturn Network is a protocol that allows access to a decentralized order book in just one transaction.
  Allowing decentralized exchanges to share a liquidity pool and feel the benefits of a much higher trading
  volume. It has been built with shared ownership in mind, SATURN token holders are part of the Saturn
  DAO: can vote on binding protocol changes & be paid our dividends from exchange fees.
