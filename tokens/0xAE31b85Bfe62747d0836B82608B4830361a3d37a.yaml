  AERGO is an open platform that allows businesses to build innovative applications and services by sharing
  data on a trustless and distributed IT ecosystem. With the ability to deploy on either public or private
  blockchain networks, AERGO gives businesses the flexibility in developing and deploying blockchain applications
  with unparalleled speed, scalability and performance. AERGO is designed as a flexible, plugin-based
  smart contract infrastructure. Client-actors can execute smart contracts written for the Ethereum Virtual
  Machine or AergoSQL. The AERGO network will be backboned by github-like public and permissioned repositories
  of Distributed Directories (DD). Implementing Smart Oracles, AERGO will also allow smart contracts to
  consume data with external services or internal databases and trigger events.
