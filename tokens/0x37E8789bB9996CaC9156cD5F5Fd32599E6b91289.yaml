  AidCoin is the ERC20 token that aims to become the preferred method to donate transparently through
  the Ethereum blockchain. The AID token will power AIDChain, a platform that provides an ecosystem of
  services through an easy-to-use interface, connecting the non-profit community while allowing full transparency
  and traceability of donations.


  AIDChainâ€™s services include an internal exchange to convert major cryptocurrencies into AidCoin, a built-in
  wallet to store and donate easily, an explorer to track donations transparently, tools to connect donors
  with all the actors involved in the non-profit sector and templates of smart contracts to run fundraising
  campaigns.
