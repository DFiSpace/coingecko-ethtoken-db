  In essence, Data Shield is a security technology that integrates “decentralization”, “crushed distributed
  storage”, “cryptography” and “blockchain”. Through the use of data shield technology, information fragmentation
  and distributed storage can be realized, so that hackers can steal data and effectively protect users'
  private information and digital assets. Based on the security of data shield technology, Data Shield
  Bank (DSC Bank) has taken the opportunity to provide asset storage, mortgage lending and bank fund services.
  Users can enjoy stable interest income while enjoying safe storage business. They can also lend digital
  assets to data shield banks by mortgage-designated digital assets. While enjoying the appreciation of
  digital assets, they can also enjoy lending leverage investment services. Do the two coins are not wrong.
  Data Shield Bank has entered the stage of development and is expected to land before June 1, 2018 to
  provide services for customers.
