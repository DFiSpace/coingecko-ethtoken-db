description: >-
  In the future, in CDS ecology, holding ecological Token means the acquisition of all community rights.
  These rights include, but are not limited to the promotion of decision-making power, incentive decision-making
  power, development decision-making power and so on. We will make community decisions inside our wallets
  in the future, link usersâ€™ currency holdings to power, and avoid power monopolies at the same time.
