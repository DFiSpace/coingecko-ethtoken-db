  Voyage is a new blockchain programming language and development kit designed to make DApp development
  easier and safer. Regardless of which public chain technology DApp uses, Voyage provides a common development
  platform. With the Voyage toolchain, DApp programming can be as simple as building a module. Each keyword
  can be spelled like a building block, and the declaration continues to be a function that can be used
  to spell into various libraries. Voyage was created to address the shortcomings of DApp programming
  and to promote the explosive growth of DApp.
