  CommerceBlock is a public blockchain infrastructure company that is architecting a platform that allows
  anyone to build and use financial products and services historically reserved for commercial banking
  customers. The CommerceBlock network will be the first technology platform that provides a combination
  of trust minimal trade, decentralised contract execution, on-chain derivatives, and asset-backed token
  issuance to public blockchains.


  The advent of the Bitcoin protocol has enabled permission-less financial innovation. CommerceBlockâ€™s
  product offerings provide a suite of tools that enables anyone to build and use services that construct
  contracts, manage trade flows, engage in multiparty dispute management, issue assets, and hedge currency
  risk. Developers and end users will be able to manage all stages of a business interaction and fulfil
  their contractual obligations by utilising the CommerceBlock platform. These services will be integrated
  into infrastructure we have already implemented. We have released the first open-source implementation
  of the pay-to-contract and homomorphic address protocol outlined by Timo Hanke and Ilja Gerhardt. The
  protocol has been designed in such a way that all business logic, customer funds, and trade details
  are managed on the client side meaning at no point does CommerceBlock have access to customer funds
  or private information.
