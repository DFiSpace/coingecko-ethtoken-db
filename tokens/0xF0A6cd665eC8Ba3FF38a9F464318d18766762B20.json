This allows instant transactions processing within the fields and automatically reconcile across all participants.\n\nAonomy Icon\nPRIVACY\nAll transactions details will be encoded within payment fields before sync back to the supernode, which will prevent highly sensitive information (eg. PII data) leaked to the public.\n\nAonomy Icon\nSCALABILITY\nPushing the transaction process to the off-chain payment fields allows us to increase transaction volume by establishing more payment fields proportionally. Therefore, the decentralized network's processing limit does not apply.\n\nAonomy Icon\nSTORAGE-RAFI\nRaFi (Redundant Array of Satellite Infrastructure) is a distributed self-replicating storage system that provides data storage for DApps deployed on ALZA blockchain.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"alza","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4706/large/jRBTvYHV_400x400.jpg?1547040004","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4706/small/jRBTvYHV_400x400.jpg?1547040004","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4706/thumb/jRBTvYHV_400x400.jpg?1547040004"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf0a6cd665ec8ba3ff38a9f464318d18766762b20"],"facebook_username":"ALZALabOfficial","homepage":["http://alza.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/ALZAProject"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"ALZA_Official","twitter_screen_name":"ALZA_Official"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":2378,"name":"Alza","public_interest_score":25.098,"symbol":"alza","tickers":[]}
