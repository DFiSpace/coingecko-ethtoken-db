E2C is built according to the ERC-20 token standards, which is used by the popular Ethereum system. This makes E2C compliant with most cryptocurrencies standards and protocols in the market, hence more compatible with most trading platforms.\n\nAt E2C, we look to an ecological and sustainable future. Our project will build towards an energy revolution, a more equitable distribution of energy, and improved control over the use and transaction of energy.\n\nConventionally, the energy market is dominated by large power plants, with control being centralized in a few people. This often results in large excessive costs for the ordinary people, such as owners of private enterprises who are dependent on energy.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"electronic-energy-coin","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8269/large/logo_%286%29.png?1557134378","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8269/small/logo_%286%29.png?1557134378","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8269/thumb/logo_%286%29.png?1557134378"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5040046,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x08ceed1e8db59acbb687a5752f0a7db815cfda5e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x08ceed1e8db59acbb687a5752f0a7db815cfda5e"],"facebook_username":"e2coin","homepage":["https://electronicenergycoin.com/"],"twitter_screen_name":"e2coin"},"liquidity_score":17.334,"market_cap_rank":3531,"name":"Electronic Energy Coin","public_interest_score":29.853,"symbol":"e2c","tickers":[{"base":"E2C","market":{"identifier":"coinsbit","name":"Coinsbit"},"target":"BTG"},{"base":"E2C","market":{"identifier":"coinsbit","name":"Coinsbit"},"target":"EUR"},{"base":"E2C","market":{"identifier":"coinsbit","name":"Coinsbit"},"target":"LTC"}]}
