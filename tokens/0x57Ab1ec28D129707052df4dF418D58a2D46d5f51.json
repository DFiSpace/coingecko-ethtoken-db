This growth has created a need for scalable and stable cryptoassets for both traders and exchanges to trade against. Existing solutions involve significant centralization or have struggled to scale to meet demand. Havven solves both of these issues through the creation of a decentralized payment network. A stablecoin that scales while avoiding the risks of centralized off-chain assets will be a huge benefit for the entire trading ecosystem. It will provide fast interexchange settlement, stable trading against ERC-20 assets, and a safe place to park value without the need to settle into fiat. Havven has made significant progress in deploying our network since the completion of the token sale (the largest in Australia at USD$30m) in February 2018. The network is built on the Ethereum blockchain and it employs two tokens, both of which are ERC20 compatible. The Havven network has been released as an open source protocol so that anyone can integrate with it, including exchanges and decentralised platforms.","developer_score":60.254,"id":"nusd","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5013/large/sUSD.png?1562212426","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5013/small/sUSD.png?1562212426","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5013/thumb/sUSD.png?1562212426"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x57Ab1ec28D129707052df4dF418D58a2D46d5f51"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/AEdUHzt"],"homepage":["https://synthetix.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io","twitter_screen_name":"synthetix_io"},"liquidity_score":24.422,"market_cap_rank":275,"name":"sUSD","public_interest_score":26.836,"symbol":"susd","tickers":[{"base":"SLTC","market":{"identifier":"synthetix","name":"Synthetix Exchange"},"target":"SUSD"},{"base":"ILINK","market":{"identifier":"synthetix","name":"Synthetix Exchange"},"target":"SUSD"},{"base":"STRX","market":{"identifier":"synthetix","name":"Synthetix Exchange"},"target":"SUSD"},{"base":"SUSD","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap (v2)"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"SUSD","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap (v2)"},"target":"USDC"}]}
