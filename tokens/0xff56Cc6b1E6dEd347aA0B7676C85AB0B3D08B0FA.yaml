  Orbs is a public blockchain acting as the production layer to complement Ethereum. Adopting Orbs alongside
  Ethereum allows DApps to enjoy the best of both chains: unmatched security, liquidity and ecosystem
  integration, together with low-fees, production-ready scalability and a suitable fee structure. Orbs
  developed two groundbreaking technologies to make this possible: Virtual Chains and Randomised Proof
  of Stake.
