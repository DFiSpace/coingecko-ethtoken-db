description: >-
  The Constant System is a decentralized global financial infrastructure that enables a new set of financial
  applications for consumers and businesses. At the heart of the Constant System, there is a decentralized,
  borderless, stable currency, called Constant. Constant is a cryptocurrency with 3 defining, differentiating
  characteristics that make it the ideal stablecoin. It is (1) a stable unit of account, (2) a secure
  store of value and (3) an efficient

  medium of exchange.

  Constant is not minted out of thin air; it is always backed by valuable assets. The first release of
  Constant is backed by the US dollar only, combining the creditworthiness and price stability of the
  US Dollar with the technological advantages of decentralized ledger technology (blockchain technology).
  By maintaining a strict 1:1 peg, Constant is 100% backed by its equivalent in USD, held in a fully audited
  Trust Vault, managed by an independent Trust Company.
