  ZPER is an ecosystem for decentralized P2P finance, built upon blockchain technology. We aim to create
  new, efficient financial environment that transcends borders and currencies. Through active cooperation
  of top established pioneering corporations in the field of P2P finance, we offer innovative flows of
  funds in global scale.


  ZPR token is a means of value exchanges that all participants of the ecosystem will be using. It is
  used as a currency in all transactions, including investments for P2P loans, reimbursement of mature
  loans, rewards for data providers, commissions for NPL purchasers. Transactions will be kept transparent
  and independent from currencies and boundaries by the use of ZPR.
