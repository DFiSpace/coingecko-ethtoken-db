  The KC Chain (referred to as KCC) develops a stylized loan contract management protocol based on the
  Ethereum (ETH) project. The agreement writes loan agreements between borrowers and lenders in smart
  contracts, automatically tracking and implementing the terms of the agreements. The KC Chain loan contract
  must be completed on the smart contract platform. Both the lender and the borrower need to register
  the platform account on the KC Chain and carry out the necessary authentication; the lending advertisements
  issued by both the lender and the borrower on the KC Chain are transparent and have strong personal
  privacy. The lenders and borrowers can issue loans or advance advertisements according to their own
  circumstances. The content includes information such as interest rate, loan term, maximum loan amount,
  and mortgage's digital asset name.
