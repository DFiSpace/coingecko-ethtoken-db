  DBX, the infrastructure for value-based data transactions built on blockchain. With the original consensus
  mechanism D-DPoS（Data-based Delegated Proof of Stake), DBX applies CES function, dynamic recurrent model
  and other mathematic tools to fix problems like ballot rigging and oligarchs with DPoS and strengthen
  the decentralized governance. DBX also offers a high-efficient and fair trading mode with a whole new
  data-testing smart contract protocol, offers a brand new incentive mechanism which makes sure each trade
  of users’ data would benefit themselves, to promote data-sharing under well protection. The massive
  data accumulated would ignite an explosive growth of Al/IoT and other applications in the DBX eco-system.
