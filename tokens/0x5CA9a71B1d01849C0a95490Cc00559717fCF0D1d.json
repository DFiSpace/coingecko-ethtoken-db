Eliminating inefficiencies in the cryptomarket, increasing scalability of smart contacts and dapps, sharding, and moving contract execution off-chain are just some of the things that make Aeternity stand out from the crowd. Aeternity powers Turing-complete smart contracts that allow the execution of credible transactions without third parties and intermediaries. It has state channels to make it possible to execute smart contracts off-chain. The blockchain enforces the smart contract code, only in the case of a disagreement between the contracting parties.\n\nIts benefits are for example, high privacy. For many business applications it's crucial to have transactions which are not recorded in public. Smart contracts executed in state channels touch the blockchain only in the case of disagreement, acting like a self-arbitrating crypto court. It has high security too. For example, state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures and unparalleled decentralization provide robust efficiency and eliminate \"\"single point of failure\"\" (SPOF) issues. The cost of buying it very low too. By leveraging state channels as the default way to run smart contracts, \u00e6ternity becomes the most efficient Turing-complete blockchain and thus enables new forms of commerce via its low cost transactions.\n\nAeternity is available on most major exchanges, where it can be traded with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>.
