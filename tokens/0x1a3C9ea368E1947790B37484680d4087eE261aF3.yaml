  vehicle manufactures. Thus making whole world a RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT centre for this upcoming technology.


  CAREON chain platform will unite all the research work from throughout the world and provide the best
  of it to automotive sector manufacturers. It is decentralize network that allows storage of all research
  work from college projects to Scientifically proven research for development of hybrid technology in
  automotive sector.


  The governments in various countries are also encouraging the adoption of hybrid cars by mandating stringent
  emission standards and providing various incentives and subsidies to buyers, which is likely to reflect
  positively on the sales of these vehicles in the near future. The global market for hybrid cars, which
  stood at US$102.88 bn in 2015, is anticipated to touch US$398.90 bn by 2024, rising at a CAGR of 16.50%
  between 2016 and 2024.


  REO primary goal is to become the world’s largest multi-asset blockchain-based cryptocurrency network.
  Careon Chain is issuing an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of the REO. Funds raised as part of the ICO will
  be used primarily to acquire new users and research in the field of hybrid car. Only REO holders will
  be able to trade on the Careon Chain network. By choosing promoters, Careon Chain will be fair to the
  community. Promoters here are the people who will be having the maximum number of references, investment
  and other promotional activities (social advice). Careonchain brings more than a decade of experience,
  a history of innovation and a strong portfolio of intellectual property to use on the careon chain network:
  all of which will allow it to exceed the goals outlined in our roadmap.


  Why will the demand for the REO Coin grow?


  CAREON is focused on the hybrid vehicle sector and its importance in our everyday lives. We all need
  to travel to different places from day to day for different purpose and many do easily 4 – 5 times per
  day, 365 days per year, for an average of 80 years.


  We believe that fuel (diesel, petrol, coal, etc) drives the different vehicles and thus causes 85% of
  earth air pollutions which is directly or indirectly affecting human life and atmosphere and causes
  global warming.


  Apart from clean water, access to adequate CLEAN air is the primary concern for most people on the Earth.
