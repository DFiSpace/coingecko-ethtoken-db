  Ravelous is the crypto ecommerce marketplace that lets users sell their stuff online for crypto.

  Sellers can accept many types of payments from buyers, and withdraw your balance in the token of their
  choosing. Buyers who do not have the currency the sellers prefer can exchange their coins for RAVE tokens
  which used for payment.

  The RAVE tokens can also be traded for other coins, and will have a value backed by the crypto-marketplace
  and the RAVE treasury that will increase over time as the treasury grows in value.
