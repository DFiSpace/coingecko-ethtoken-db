  ABST aims to build a virtual reality ecosystem based on blockchain technology to connect virtual reality
  content, creators and users. VR/AR is recognized as the next-generation general-purpose computing platform.
  ABST will assume the important task of promoting the virtual reality industry's ecological development
  and accelerate the advent of the VR/AR era. ABST will solve three major problems in VR applications:
  trust mechanism, equity distribution and content circulation: The ABST protocol, built on the basis
  of non-mutability, solves the trust problem in the virtual world and will become the cornerstone of
  the user relationship in the ABST virtual world. The decentralization setup allows any user to create
  a reasonable distribution of benefits in the ABST, whether producing contents or providing services;
  ABST l is a large ecology of virtual reality content. It will stimulate active behavior through unique
  ecological mechanisms and enhance the circulation of content. ABST is composed of industry elites from
  the field of virtual reality, while at the same time they are supported by experts and scholars from
  the blockchain field. ABST has reached strategic partnerships with leading VR companies in the world,
  and is actively promoting the layout and ecological construction of global virtual reality content.
