description: >-
  NNS is the NEO Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the NEO blockchain.
  Our primary goal is to replace irregular string such as wallet address and smart contract Hash which
  are hard to memorize for humans with words and phrases. We will offer ending in “.neo” name service
  first. Through name service, people don’t need to remember address and Hash they don’t understand anymore.
  You could make a transfer or use contracts by just knowing a word or phrase. NNS can be used to resolve
  a wide variety of resources. The initial standard for NNS defines resolution for NEO addresses or Smart
  contracts(ScriptHash), but the system is extensible, allowing more resource types to be resolved in
  future without NNS upgrades.
