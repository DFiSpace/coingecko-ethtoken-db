  USDC is a fully collateralized US dollar stablecoin. USDC is the bridge between dollars and trading
  on cryptocurrency exchanges. The technology behind CENTRE makes it possible to exchange value between
  people, businesses and financial institutions just like email between mail services and texts between
  SMS providers. We believe by removing artificial economic borders, we can create a more inclusive global
  economy.
