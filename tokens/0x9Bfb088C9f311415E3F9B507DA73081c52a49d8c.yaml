  There will only be 100 of these cassette tapes manufactured, and they are being sold using $TAPEâ€”a digital
  token which represents them. This means that they can be bought, sold and traded like a cryptocurrency.


  Purchasing exactly 1 $TAPE will entitle you to one real good, shipped anywhere in the world.
