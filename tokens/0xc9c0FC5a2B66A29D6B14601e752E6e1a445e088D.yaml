description: >-
  nOS is a virtual operating system that introduces a new, decentralized internet. On this new internet
  user data is safe, and it only goes where the user wants it to go. nOS solves key issues surrounding
  dApp development, deployment, discovery, and interaction, allowing for true adoption of decentralized
  applications and blockchain technology. Because applications can choose to make their back-ends fully
  open-source and transparent, this new implementation of the World Wide Web is defined as the Open Internet.


  On nOS, applications and websites can be deployed in a completely open and decentralized manner by integrating
  smart contracts, client-side code, and public-key cryptography.


  Unlike server-side backend code, smart contracts can be open for all to read, allowing users to review
  how their data will be transmitted before any final commitments to action.


  Client-side code and other frontend materials can be distributed via nOS Filesystem, a decentralized
  file sharing protocol that allows for secure and transparent distribution of static files.


  By serving both backend logic and frontend material in an open-source, decentralized manner, true transparency
  between user and application can be achieved.


  dApps that are deployed to nOS can be accessed through nOS Client, a software solution for desktop and
  mobile that (among other features) introduces nOS Browser.


  nOS Browser functions as a web browser, with the added benefit that it integrates with the nOS Protocol,
  a blockchain-powered web protocol that facilitates secure and open accessibility of nOS dApps.


  The nOS Protocol resolves domain names that exist on nOS Name Service, a blockchain-powered decentralized
  implementation of a Domain Name Service, and allows for dApps to register domain names which are discoverable
  on nOS (e.g. mydapp.neo or my-dapp.eth).


  The dApp Gateway is a user-friendly dApp discovery platform (or “App Store”) where rankings are decided
  in a completely decentralized manner via Decentralized Authority.


  In order to achieve the features such as the ones described above, nOS is powered by the nOS Utility
  Token.


  The nOS Utility Token employs various staking and reward utilities which are intended for developers
  who wish to deploy and maintain dApps on nOS, and for end-users who wish to practice governance by Decentralized
  Authority.


  nOS eliminates the need for end-users to manually exchange crypto-currencies in order to make use of
  various dApps. By integrating crypto-currency exchange APIs, nOS Client automatically converts primary
  blockchain platform currencies (e.g. NEO/GAS for NEO, ETH for Ethereum) into the required amount of
  application tokens that are needed to make specific transactions or invocations.
