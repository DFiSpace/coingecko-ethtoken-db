What this means is that their price can never drop below that of the price of the US Dollar, so that they are always redeemable/exchangeable for at least $1.00, or whatever the current market value stipulates if higher. Exactly the same as Bitcoin, the total supply is capped at 21 Miilion coins so there will never be more than 21 Million coins in existance.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"merlin-coins","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8940/large/MAGIC-MERC-MAGIC-1024.png?1563116948","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8940/small/MAGIC-MERC-MAGIC-1024.png?1563116948","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8940/thumb/MAGIC-MERC-MAGIC-1024.png?1563116948"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x3a08b85d00eb899afe3bb382fe7375926880718f"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/TYghuzg"],"facebook_username":"merlinsmoneytree","homepage":["https://merlincoins.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"MagicMerlin4"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":2787,"name":"MERLIN COINS","public_interest_score":36.74,"symbol":"merc","tickers":[{"base":"MERC","market":{"identifier":"digitalprice","name":"DigitalPrice"},"target":"BTC"}]}
