  Cryptonity is the combination of two words: Crypto and Community.


  Simple but strong and meaningful, our goal is to be an exchange that is respected by the Cryptocurrency
  Community. We aim at providing the most comprehensive, secure, transparent and collaborative exchange
  platform in the market.


  We want to bring good vibes to the Crypto World, breaking with the ‘only profit’ policy of most exchanges.


  A Community centric trading platform

  Involve the crypto community in the evolution of the platform to meet their needs and requests: features
  to be developed, coins to be listed, etc.


  Responsive multilingual customer service, low fees and fully transparent policy.


  “Forks”, “Airdrops”, “Staking Rewards” and “Masternode” features to be implemented.


  A comprehensive “Cryptosystem”

  Provide our users with the most ergonomic and performant trading tools.


  Users who own our Cryptonity Token (XNY) to be granted with the lowest fees in the market.


  We plan to develop our own Blockchain and a decentralised exchange with the participation of our community
  through a rewarded program.


  Security & Insurance

  Provide our users the most secure trading platform, working with the best security experts in the market,
  audited twice a year by independent security companies.


  First crypto exchange to provide an insurance to refund our users in case of losses
