  SocialX is a decentralized social media platform allowing users to distribute content seamlessly. Just
  imagine: photo and videos app that will store your files decentrally and securely in a single platform;
  built-in license management will allow you to decide if you want to keep your photos private or if you
  want to sell photo rights to others in exchange for SOCX tokens. SocialX is a community-driven project
  developed with the userâ€™s best interest at heart.
