The Caribbean free trade zone issues blockchain operating licenses and digital asset exchange licenses for blockchain companies in the zone for license management. These licenses are valid in both the free trade zone and international jurisdictions. To guide the effective growth of the free trade zone's financial technology norms, the PE Chain Management Committee has introduced \"regulatory sandboxes\" to deal with risks associated with blockchain financial innovation. Through this \"sandbox\" mechanism, the government can make a variety of financial innovations within the controllable range, as well as enables entrepreneurs to feel free to experiment with a variety of related innovative businesses, making it conducive to encouraging innovation in financial technology, guiding the development of blockchain technology, further enhancing the protection of financial consumers, and enhancing the adaptability of supervision to innovation.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"pe-chain","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6952/large/pe-chain.png?1547043333","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6952/small/pe-chain.png?1547043333","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6952/thumb/pe-chain.png?1547043333"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x70d0efcadf013e1cdd88870c7b23737dbc19b523"],"homepage":["http://www.pechain.io/"]},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":4832,"name":"PE Chain","public_interest_score":35.183,"symbol":"pec","tickers":[{"base":"PEC","market":{"identifier":"fcoin","name":"FCoin"},"target":"ETH"}]}
