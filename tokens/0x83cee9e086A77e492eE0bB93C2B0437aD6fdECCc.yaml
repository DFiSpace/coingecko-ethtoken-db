  GoldMint PTE LTD is a Russian-Singaporean blockchain-company, whose main goal is to completely reform
  the market of loans secured by gold, by implementing complex blockchain-solutions and automatizing the
  process of evaluating gold items.


  GoldMint is developing a digital asset GOLD, that is 100% backed by real gold, bought under delivery
  futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This asset acts as a stable unit in the cryptocurrency market,
  and also is used for issuing loans as a liquid collateral, and this way increases the transparency and
  security of the whole industry.


  GOLD assets operate in GoldMints custom blockchain which has a unique consensus algorithm, based on
  Sumus solutions. GOLD operations are maintained by MNTP token holders, rewarded by a 75% commission
  fee.


  For an automatic evaluation process and decreasing the price of storing gold items, GoldMint is developing
  a vending gold storage "Custom Bot", equipped with a spectrometer, scales, cells for storage, and connected
  to the blockchain. All inspection data of the items will stored onto the blockchain, by so, providing
  transparency of the processes.
