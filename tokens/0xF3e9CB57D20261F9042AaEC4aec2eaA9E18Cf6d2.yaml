description: >-
  The BlockChain Tremiss design team relied on many years of

  experience and innovation in other developers' cryptographic systems. With BlockChain

  Tremiss, your digital assets and messages will be completely safe!

  Tremiss protects privacy through an anonymous protocol and BlockChain, which stores

  tokens, not transactions. In addition, it quickly achieves the end result by not using traditional

  signature-based payment processing in favor of hash-based authentication.
