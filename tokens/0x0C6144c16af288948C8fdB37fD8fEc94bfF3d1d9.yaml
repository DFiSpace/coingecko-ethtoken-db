description: >-
  Neutral Dollar is an entirely new blockchain-native financial instrument. The on-chain token processes
  revolve around the profit-seeking behavior of rational arbitrageurs and mimics properties of a traditional
  ETF in a fully transparent way.


  Creation activity drives the expansion of the Neutral token supply and the redemption mechanics cause
  the supply to contract. This results in globally-shared liquidity, reduced volatility, and frictionless
  token exchange.
