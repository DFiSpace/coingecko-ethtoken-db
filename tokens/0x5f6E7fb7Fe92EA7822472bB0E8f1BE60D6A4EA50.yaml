  Artemine is intended to be the version 2.0 of Minereum - The First Self Mining Smart Contract.


  The goal is to continue the evolution of Smart Contract technology with the focus on new blockchain
  mining approaches, in particular the Smart Contract Self-Mining principle.


  The Self-Mining principle relies on the basis that the Token will mine the coins itself for a specific
  amount of time without the direct need of Mining equipment or Miners. The token supply is automatically
  generated on the fly by a mathematical formula.


  Artemine brings the following new features:


  - Genesis Addresses with different supply

  - Possibility to Transfer Genesis Addresses

  - Automatic Sale of Genesis Addresses

  - Public Mining
