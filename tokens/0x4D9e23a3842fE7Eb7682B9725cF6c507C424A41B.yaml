  CarBlock is the world’s first blockchain-based transportation solution built on data generated by smart
  devices. This circulation of car data on the blockchain is set to disrupt the entire connected car industry.


  P2P Car Rental


  Through hardware enabled data collection and smart contracts, CarBlock eliminates unnecessary conflicts,
  any ambiguity in responsibilities and the loss of potential property for P2P rental transactions. CarBlock
  also provides greater safety and ease of use for P2P rental applications.


  Auto Insurance


  Auto insurance companies can boost their competitive edge by using CarBlock data to optimize their premium
  modeling and offer more tailored and flexible packages to customers. Car owners can also enjoy better
  pricing by authorizing insurance companies access to their car’s data and pay with CAR tokens to get
  their insurance coverage.


  Used Car Dealerships and Car Reports


  The immutability of the data on the CarBlock blockchain allows for the creation of trustworthy vehicle
  reports for used car transactions. Data owners can earn CAR tokens in exchange for granting third parties
  access to their data. Used car buyers and sellers can form better deals and enjoy safer transactions,
  knowing that the vehicle’s conditions have been verified with real data and smart contracts.


  Working with amazing partners

  CarBlock is working with the US Connected Car Leader nonda as its anchor partner in order to leverage
  nonda's community and expand its current business services.
