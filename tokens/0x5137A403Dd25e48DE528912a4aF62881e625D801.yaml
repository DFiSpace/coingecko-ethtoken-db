  Huddl is founded by former BlackRock and Mastercard executives and established blockchain entrepreneurs.
  It is the first platform where everyday investors can collaborate, pool their assets and get access
  to products and services previously only available for the wealthy. Investors and financial service
  providers both benefit from the Huddl platform. Everyday investors pay lower fees and receive unprecedented
  access to investment managers, strategies and products through an easy to use mobile platform. Providers
  benefit from expanded opportunity and direct access to end investors.


  Huddl's mission is to channel the collective aspirations, networks, and buying power of the general
  public such that every individual derives the maximum monetary and functional benefit from their consumption
  and investing activities.
