  Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding
  and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
  or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>. The white paper mentions that
  the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa
  is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing
  your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the
  key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.


  Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups
  and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups
  for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of
  transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases
  in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity
  is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating
  the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too.


  Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding
  technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed
  to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners
  in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The
  Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the
  crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.
