  Freelancercoin is an online freelancing platform that is built entirely on Ethereum and provides an
  innovative approach for freelancers and clients to safely and securely work together. Naturally, it
  allows for standard features that have been used in existing platforms, such as the posting of potential
  jobs by clients for freelancers to apply to, and the ability to set up smart contracts by which payments
  are made through our ICO token.  However, through the use of Blockchain and artificial intelligence
  (AI) technology, Freelancecoin aims to achieve several objectives.
