  Grenade is an open-source, community-powered kamikaze currency. Grenade (GREN) is a kamikaze cryptocurrency.
  The GREN token is an ERC-20 standard-based Ethereum token. We issued a fixed amount of 600,000 GREN
  tokens (ERC-20 token with 0 decimal places). The total token supply is 600,000 GREN tokens. Every GREN
  token transfer will destroy 1% of the transaction. For example, X person sends 100 GREN to Y person.
  1 GREN will destroy and Y person will receive 99 GREN. We can’t change or manipulate the current code.

  Every GREN token burn is a deflationary measure helping to increase the token value and retain the confidence
  of the token holders. When reduces the supply of a GREN token, makes it’s value raise. Burning tokens
  then make the remaining ones very valuable. No new tokens will be created or mined.
