The LCD token will be used on Lucyd's platform to power a decentralized app store, to purchase hardware from Lucyd, for rapid peer-to-peer transactions in AR smartglasses, to reward high quality app developers, and reward community engagement. Our mission is to make truly user-friendly smartglasses, and a blockchain-based AR app ecosystem. Lucyd owns a portfolio of 13 unique, exclusively-licensed AR patents that will allow for the development of an interactive AR display that is lightweight, ergonomic, comfortable, has a wide field of view, auto-adjusts to lighting conditions, accommodates corrective lenses and appears like a normal pair of glasses. Lucyd Lens will be an AR peripheral compatible with existing Android and iOS devices and apps, while also supporting Lucyd-native content.","id":"lucyd","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@lucydltd"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2218055,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a4059c1cf329a017e0ee1337c503137fd9463b2"],"facebook_username":"LucydLtd","homepage":["https://lucyd.co/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Lucydofficial/","telegram_channel_identifier":"lucyd_en","twitter_screen_name":"LucydLtd"},"name":"Lucyd","symbol":"lcd","tickers":[{"base":"LCD","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"33482C9F-175F-434E-A04F-2B9DC52E36EF","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"33482C9F-175F-434E-A04F-2B9DC52E36EF","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LCD","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]}
