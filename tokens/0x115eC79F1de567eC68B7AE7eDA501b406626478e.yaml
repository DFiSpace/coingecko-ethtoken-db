  Carry is a platform that connects offline merchants and consumers using blockchain.


  Carry Protocol aims to resolve these problems with three objectives:

  1) provide a platform for merchants to understand their customers and communicate with them

  2) enable consumers to control their own transaction data and monetize the information.

  3) offer a new advertising channel that is effective and transparent.
