PRL is the economic bridge between content publishers, content consumers, storage providers, and storage consumers. Oyster is a revolutionary protocol that resets the assumptions of the current internet paradigm and addresses the aforementioned issues with a new comprehensive platform. Oyster\u2019s primary operation is based off of the storage, retention, and retrieval of static data.
