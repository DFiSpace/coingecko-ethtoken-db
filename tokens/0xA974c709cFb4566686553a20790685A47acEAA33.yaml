  Mixin is a crypto network in the market that is built on the Directed acyclic graph and Byzantine Fault-Tolerant
  protocols.  This app aims to help other publicly distributed ledgers gain trillions of TPS, achieve
  sub second final confirmations, zero transaction fees, enhanced privacy and unlimited extensibility.
  It allows people to transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens between each other privately via an encrypted
  blockchain. The founders have promised to support decentralized applications (DApps) development and
  near instant transactions to their users. This is because the Mixin DAG is equipped with a BFT which
  gives Mixin Network more than 1,000,000,000,000 TPS capacity with a final confirmation time of under
  1 second. Mixin may well lead the future of mobile cryptocurrency payments with the technology and efficiency
  provided.


  The latest news about Mixin coin is that Japan has finally approve self-regulation for cryptocurrency
  exchanges. The Japanese Financial Agency has granted Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (VCEA)
  the ability to sanction its members for violating rules. The VCEA was formed by a self-regulatory organization
  by all of Japan’s licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in the aftermath of the cyberattack on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coincheck">Coincheck</a>.
  Therefore, the association’s rules for its members are stricter than the current requirement by Japanese
  Law. The last time FSA approved a new cryptocurrency exchange to operate in Japan was December 2017.
