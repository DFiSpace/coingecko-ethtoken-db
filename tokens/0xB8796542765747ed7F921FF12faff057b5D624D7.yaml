description: >-
  VOID is a community owned and operated HYPER-deflationary token. 5% of every transaction is burned on
  the blockchain. Over time, this leads to less supply as more transactions take place. To ensure fair
  and even distribution, the Void tokens were airdropped to hundreds of people at equal amounts, without
  any being held by the creator. This puts the power and responsibility in the hands of the community,
  who has been working together to make this project a success.
