  Clap Clap Token (CCT) is a simple and transparent tipping token dedicated to street art and urban culture.


  Art metropolis like Melbourne or Berlin attract hordes of tourists every year and offer a visual feast
  for the public. The city becomes the canvas of talented artists coming from all over the world.


  CCT intends to valorize these open-air galleries and gives the opportunity to reward street artists
  for their exceptional work. Visitors can leave a tip as a virtual form of appreciation for the urban
  discoveries on offer.
