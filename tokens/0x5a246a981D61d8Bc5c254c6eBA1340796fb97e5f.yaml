description: >-
  VNC will support the emerging blockchain-based distributed applications, through the construction of
  computing models to achieve cost-effective distributed edge computing architecture, high performance,
  low cost computing.


  Distributed computing based on blockchains will be fast. Access to the most competitive computing infrastructure,
  security and low cost on demand.Dapp will rely on esc to automatically search, find, supply, use and
  release all composite materials resources.


  VNC envisions a new ecosystem of storage, computing platforms, data support programs, web hosting, and
  SaaS applications, all delivered via VNC tokens. Decentralized clouds will open up new markets to aggressively
  use existing composite infrastructure, reducing the amount of energy needed to operate servers and cloud
  systems that can be pushed out of data centers. By simplifying the process of computing data, distributed
  cloud computing is realized.
