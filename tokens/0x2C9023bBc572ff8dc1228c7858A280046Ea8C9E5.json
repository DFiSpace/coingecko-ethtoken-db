The project is led by the VideoCoin Development Association Ltd. (Cayman Islands). Powered by a large-scale, distributed video infrastructure, the VideoCoin Network will usher in \"the new cloud,\" by marshaling underutilized computing resources from around the world to revolutionize video services with blockchain technology. The VideoCoin Network ecosystem will lower costs by deploying unused compute resources and peer-to-peer video distribution, enabling a new generation of applications via open APIs and open source-based development, with increased privacy using decentralized, end-to-end encryption.\n\nThe VideoCoin Network is the first blockchain project to integrate a third party fiat payment processor, underpinned by a consortium of banks.
