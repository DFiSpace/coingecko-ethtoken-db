  MaxiMineCoin allows token holders to stake their tokens in return for hashing power assigned to mine
  a cryptocurrency of their choice. MaxiMine will allow its users to freely switch between different tokens
  and mining pools to allow them to maximize their profits and returns. MaxiMine will also be one of the
  first few to receive state of the art and early releases of advanced mining rigs such as the Bitmain
  ASIC for Ethereum (as seen on CNBC). MXM tokens provide the opportunity to be part of partnerships most
  outsiders can never attain.
