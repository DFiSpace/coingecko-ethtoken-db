description: >-
  MDC Token is the built-in native encrypted digital token of the MDC Peony Chain Network, which can be
  used for trading, settlement, and smart contracts on the chain. Its value is based on two points: First,
  the application on the MDC needs to consume a certain MDC Token as fuel. Second, holding the MDC can
  participate in the community governance of the MDC Chain. As a link to maintain the operation of the
  MDC chain ecosystem, MDC is a guarantee for the closure of the large ecological circle.
