description: >-
  Bitcoin Classic Token is a faster Bitcoin implementation on a real decentralized immutable blockchain
  (Ethereum Classic) with usable smart contracts, and is also the first mineable ERC223 Token running
  on the Ethereum Classic Blockchain. It is designed to be used as a decentralized ‘bitcoin-like’ token
  within the Ethereum Classic ecosystem and beyond. It avoids problems related to centralization as seen
  on Ethereum and security because it is powered by the Ethereum Classic Network and by globally distributed
  anonymous miners. Since it follows a standard protocol (ERC223), it is stored in a traditional Ethereum
  Classic wallet such as Classic Ether Wallet or the Saturn Wallet. Since every BCT token has been mined
  in a completely decentralized manner, there is no central body or central organization which controls
  or enforces any aspect of BCT.
