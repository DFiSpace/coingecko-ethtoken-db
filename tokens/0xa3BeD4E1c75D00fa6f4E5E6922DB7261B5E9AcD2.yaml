description: >-
  mStable has a protocol token, Meta (MTA), with three core functions:

  To act as the ultimate source of re-collateralisation

  To coordinate decentralised governance

  To incentivise bootstrapping of mASSET liquidity, utility and a community of Governors


  In return for performing these functions and taking on the risk of partial liquidation in a peg loss
  event, governors can choose for Meta tokens to earn income from fees collected in the platform and interest
  generated on its underlying assets. This will be decided in future once mStable is sufficiently decentralised.
