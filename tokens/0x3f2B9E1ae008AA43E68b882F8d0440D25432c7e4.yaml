  WIA is the first block chain project launched by Walden Goton Digital Asset Team . Based on block chain
  technology, WIA constructs a decentralized game ecosystem composed of players, software developers and
  game operators. The ecosystem includes multiple nodes such as video games, Internet devices, development
  components, personal devices and so on. WIA enables data and value transmission between each node by
  using standard token WIAC. WIA decentralization game ecology can be found and linked to all games, allowing
  players and developers to explore freely.


  In addition to its high degree of freedom,WIA also provides basic application scenarios for players
  and developers: block dog pet games, IP asset reuse, game asset trading, game recommendation systems,
  etc.
