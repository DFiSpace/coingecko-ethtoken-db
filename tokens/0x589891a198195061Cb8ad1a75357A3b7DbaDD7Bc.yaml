  Contentos is a decentralized global content ecosystem invested by Binance Labs (the blockchain incubator
  of worldâ€™s largest exchange, https://labs.binance.com), DHVC and various class-leading funds. Contentos
  TestNet was launched and its real-time network status can be viewed on Contentos Block Explorer (https://explorer.contentos.io).
  It aims to create a decentralized content ecosystem, where assets can be freely produced, authenticated,
  and distributed. The team consists of experts from the content industry, who have worked on top-tier
  consumer applications and blockchain projects. Contentos is not only a blueprint for what digital content
  ecosystem might look like in the future but we have multiple working use cases: Contentos is working
  with strategic partners, LiveMe and Cheetah Mobile, that have amassed over 60+ million monthly active
  users. With real-time user feedback, Contentos will become a premier blockchain project as it places
  the interest of users first.
