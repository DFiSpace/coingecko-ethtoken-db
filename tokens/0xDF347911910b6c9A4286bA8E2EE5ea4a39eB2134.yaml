  Anyone that has hired a contractor in recent years for home repairs has faced three problems: false
  information due to review fraud, hidden costs due to advertising fees, and inflated prices due to lack
  of pricing transparency. Bobâ€™s Repair is here to change that.


  The Prandecki brothers, together with blockchain experts and experienced software engineers, founded
  Bob's Repair with the mission of launching a decentralized platform that will bring trust and fair pricing
  back to the consumer.


  In order to fight review fraud, advertising fees and provide the consumer with transparency, the Bob's
  Repair Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain, which has a three second block time and no
  transaction costs.
