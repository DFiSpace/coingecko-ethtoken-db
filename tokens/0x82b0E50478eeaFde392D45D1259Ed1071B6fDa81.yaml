  Genomic data is extremely sensitive. Most people are not aware that your DNA contains information about
  your life expectancy, your proclivity to depression or schizophrenia, your complete ethnic ancestry,
  your expected intelligence, maybe even your political inclinations. Within a decade or two your genome
  will likely reveal even more.
