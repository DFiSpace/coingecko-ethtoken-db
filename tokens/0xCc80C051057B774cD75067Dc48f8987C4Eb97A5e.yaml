description: >-
  The Nectar token is not intended to raise funds for <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/ethfinex">Ethfinex</a>,
  and will not be sold through any form of crowdsale, ICO or fundraising mechanism. Instead, the Nectar
  token will act as a loyalty token. The NEC is designed to maintain liquidity and market efficiency through
  the incentivisation of platform loyalty. Users who choose to register for the scheme and take on the
  role of market maker on the Ethfinex platform, or using integrated decentralised exchange protocols,
  will automatically generate NEC’s, as a loyalty reward, and subsequently earn a stake in the future
  development, governance and success of the platform. NEC will adhere to the ERC20 Token Standard to
  ensure cross-compatibility with alternate exchange protocols interfacing with Ethfinex. This allows
  other protocols and exchanges to reward users for the liquidity they contribute.


  The fundamental purpose of the Nectar token is to reward market makers for the value they create, in
  turn encouraging them to maintain market thickness and minimised spreads on the platform trading pairs.
  Loyalty points entitle holders to loyalty rewards held in the Liquidity Token Smart Contract, which
  can be redeemed (in part or in whole) through the Redeem Mechanism upon request. Loyalty points can
  be traded on a secondary market amongst white listed Ethfinex users. If no tokens are redeemed at the
  end of a 28 day cycle, the total supply of NEC will grow. Ethfinex will hold an initial supply of NEC
  which will not grow over time — as a result, the percentage ownership will gradually decrease as new
  tokens are issued and redeemed.


  The exact governance mechanism will be particularly important in ensuring the details and implementation
  of the token can be refined in time for the Ethfinex launch. Defining the perfect liquidity incentive
  mechanism will be impossible without continuous testing and feedback in real markets, and the governance
  will complete the loop in allowing improvements to take place. Following community feedback, we have
  decided against the internal redesign of the chosen governance mechanism; instead, we will look to adopt
  the industry best practise. There are a number of fantastic projects in the space who are currently
  working on this, such as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon">Aragon</a> and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x">District0x</a>,
  some of whom we are in contact with, and we are eager to refine our governance model in accordance with
  them.


  Ethfinex has come out with a smart solution and is not organizing a direct ICO but I see it as an indirect
  one with a long-term range into the future where decentralized exchanges will be the future or crypto-economy.
  Ethfinex’s and Nectar’s token development will bring all the ERC20 tokens under one platform dedicated
  to Ethereum token economy which in itself will be a huge thing. The total initial supply of NEC is 1
  billion tokens out which the current circulating supply is 500,000,000 NEC. This supply will be distributed
  to the team and early adopters as loyalty points and this will also keep growing every 30 days, with
  new tokens being created based on market maker programme.
