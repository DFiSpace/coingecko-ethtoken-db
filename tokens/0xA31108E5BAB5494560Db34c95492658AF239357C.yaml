  The DACSEE platform ("Decentralized Alternative Cabs Serving & Empowering Everyone") is the world’s
  first fully decentralized and autonomous social ride-sharing service. DACSEE drivers purchase DACSEE
  Token (a cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain) but may accept fares from passengers with
  the same token or any other traditional fiat method. When a fare is collected, almost all of it is returned
  to the platform stakeholders which consists of drivers, passengers and government authorities. This
  unique design enables DACSEE to expand virally without assistance or control from any corporate entity.
  The peer-to-peer payment methods and ability for drivers to use the platform to foster their own income-producing
  Circle of Friends™ of drivers allows DACSEE to spread autonomously into new markets around the world,
  disrupting the current ride-hailing landscape.
