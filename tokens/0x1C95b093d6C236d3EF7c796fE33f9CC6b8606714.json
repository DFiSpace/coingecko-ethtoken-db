Through a system of immutable smart contracts and continuous hyperdeflation,\u00a0BOMB is the world\u2019s first self-destructing currency.","id":"bomb","links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x1C95b093d6C236d3EF7c796fE33f9CC6b8606714","https://etherscan.io/token/0x1C95b093d6C236d3EF7c796fE33f9CC6b8606714","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1C95b093d6C236d3EF7c796fE33f9CC6b8606714"],"homepage":["https://www.bombtoken.com"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/bombtoken","telegram_channel_identifier":"bombtoken","twitter_screen_name":"bombtoken"},"name":"BOMB","symbol":"bomb","tickers":[{"base":"BOMB","market":{"identifier":"ddex","name":"DDEX"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"BOMB","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"}]}
