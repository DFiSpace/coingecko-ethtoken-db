  "ETHERBURN (ETB) is a self-destructing token, community-based currency. The ETB token

  is an ERC-20 standard-based Ethereum token. We issued a fixed amount of 500,000 ETB

  tokens (ERC-20 token with 8 decimal places). Every time ETB is transferred, 2% of the

  transaction is destroyed. That means the recipient will only get 98% of the total transactions,

  so each transaction made will reduce global supply.

  Every ETB token destroyed is a deflationary measure helping to increase the token value

  and retain the confidence of the token holders. When reduces the supply of a ETB token,

  makes it's value raise. Destroying tokens then make the remaining ones very valuable. No

  new tokens will be created or mined"
