  NATIVE MULTICHAIN PLATFORM

  PCHAIN is the first native multichain system in the world that supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM),
  which consists of one main chain and multiple derived chains.


  CONSENSUS WITH HIERARCHICAL SHARDING PIPELINE

  POS based multi layer sharding mechanism with a novel pipeline design that tremendously improves the
  performance of transactions.


  SMART CONTRACTS BASED ON SMART DATA

  A new Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge graph makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts.
  W3C compliant smart data effectively adresses the issue of nonintelligence in smart contracts.


  CROSS CHAIN INVOCATION AND TRANSACTIONS

  The smart contracts of PCHAIN can be easily invoked with other nonnative Tokens (BCH, ERC20) by using
  the provided toolkit.
