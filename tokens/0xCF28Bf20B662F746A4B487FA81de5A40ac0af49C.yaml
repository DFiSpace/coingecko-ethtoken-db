description: >-
  Goldreserve (Symbol: XGR) is the next step digital currency. The coin is designed and created because
  there are not one altcoin existing which brings users the feeling that it will give a steady growth
  and if things go sideways, and coins can be easily liquidated at any time without a huge loss. GoldReserve
  meets all those demands. The Stabilizer Fund, collected during the POW phase - will be converted into
  GOLD which will serve as the backup of the coin. With this fund, the developers will enable to buy back
  directly each and every existing GoldReserve coins.
