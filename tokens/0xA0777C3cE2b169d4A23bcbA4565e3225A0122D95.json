Our Distributed Exchange Asset Ledger (D.E.A.L.) decentralized application (DApp) eliminates any third party or central authority.\n\nAphelion ends: high fees, delays, frozen funds, locked trades and hijacked tokens. All Aphelion initiated trades are done directly on-chain or cross-chain and directly between users with terms they set, accept and complete themselves. As a bonus, APH tokens spent during P2P trading are automatically redistributed to all APH token holders; similar to the NEO/GAS relationship. Aphelion is not a hosted exchange, it never holds or stores tokens and is totally open source, community driven and most importantly: DECENTRALIZED.","developer_score":35.09,"id":"aphelion","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4040/large/aphelion.png?1547039167","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4040/small/aphelion.png?1547039167","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4040/thumb/aphelion.png?1547039167"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://aphelion.org/blog.html","https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2315163.0"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2315147,"blockchain_site":["https://neotracker.io/asset/a0777c3ce2b169d4a23bcba4565e3225a0122d95"],"homepage":["https://aphelion.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/aphtoken/aph-wallet-gui","https://github.com/aphtoken/neo"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/APH/","telegram_channel_identifier":"AphelionToken","twitter_screen_name":"apheliontoken"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":1603,"name":"Aphelion","public_interest_score":25.207,"symbol":"aph","tickers":[]}
