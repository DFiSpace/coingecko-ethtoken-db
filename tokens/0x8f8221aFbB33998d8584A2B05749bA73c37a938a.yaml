description: >-
  A decentralized network built on top of Ethereum, which allows anyone, anywhere to request a payment.
  The request can be detected and paid in a secure way, without the need to involve a third party. The
  request is saved on an immutable, authentic ledger, which acts as a unique source of truth for accounting
  and auditing processes. Request integrates a trade law system and works across every legislation. Request
  works with every global currency. Request is designed to be flexible, to last hundreds of years, and
  to work with IoT, whilst being compatible with any future systems.


  Request donation modal went live today. Thought you might be interested to include it in your footer
  instead of just the addresses. As an FYI, it's fully decentralized and free to use -- we don't take
  any added fees (the only cost is the Ethereum gas). It can be integrated with a simple code snippet.


  Anyways, check it out if you have a chance -- here's a link to the site: https://donations.request.network/
