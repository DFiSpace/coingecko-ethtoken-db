  Max [MVG] tokens are the utility & gateway to the successful application of Token Distribution Investment
  Platform (TDIP) technology, by enabling projects, such as Maxvest, to simeltaneously and easily create
  long or short-term capital crowdfunding ventures while distributing a digital token or currency to its
  investors.


  Max is the first ever token tied to a TDIP, meaning it will not only serve as a valuating indicator
  of the Maxvest Group and its subsidiary products & endeavours, but additionally serve as the very first
  token to be used in conjunction with TDIP technology, allowing start-up projects and enterprises alike
  to see real-use and live production before deciding to use the technology, once it is made public.
