  FNKOS is a fog computing-based blockchain operating system designed to make the best use of the edge
  computing resources such as idle hardware network and storage resources. The fog blockchain was built
  on the basis of a PoC (Proof of Contribution) consensus algorithm: nodes get FNKOS incentives according
  to their contribution in the fog blockchain based on network flow, storage volume, computational capacity.
