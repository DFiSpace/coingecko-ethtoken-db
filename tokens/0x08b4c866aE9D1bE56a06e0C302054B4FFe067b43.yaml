  Bitcar.io is a decentralized trading platform for Exotics. BitCar is a blockchain-based platform that
  allows for fractional ownership in the best performing luxury asset class of the last decade - collectable
  exotic cars. For the first time the mass market will have access to this asset class, which is tradable
  on BitCar's live auction peer-to-peer trading platform. Additionally, the live auction platform allows
  users to eventually trade their way up to full ownership of an exotic, allowing them to have the option
  to take the exotic for themselves. BITCAR tokens can be used to access the Bitcar.io platform and can
  be exchanged in CAR tokens which are backed up by the physical, hard-metal exotic cars and pegged to
  their USD value- acting as a "stable coin". This provides relative protection in times of crypto volatility.
  BITCAR tokens are also accepted by selected exotic car dealerships.
