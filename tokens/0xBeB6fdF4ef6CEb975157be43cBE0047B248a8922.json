It will be used in all scenarios of ARP ecosystems. The total number of ARP is fixed at 1000,000,000. ARP will serve as the digital voucher proving that owners of device have shared their devices, and ensuring the distribution of ARP tokens via smart contracts. The ARP fund will develop DApp based on ARP value protocol and airdrop a portion of DApp tokens as candies to users. Users only need to lock the tokens in smart contracts as required. In the ARP value protocol system, every decision is made by voting within a particular period of time. Length of time may differ for different proposals. Proposals will be executed only when enough votes in favour are collected; otherwise they will be rejected. So in this decentralized ARP system, individuals with the biggest votes do not have the power to decide everything. Small votes also have a say, as they can unite and hold the former in check.\n\nIn the future, all shared smart devices need to hold a certain amount of ARPs in their accounts as the sharing vouchers, and all registered miners need to have some ARPs in hand to prevent the destruction and abuse of the system by inactive smart devices and miners.\n\nARP\u00b7\u963f\u666e\u534f\u8bae\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea4\u6613\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u662f\u201cARP\u201d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002ARP\u5373App Rendering Power\uff0c\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd0\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u624b\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u6296\u97f3\uff0cPC\u8fd0\u884c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7b49\u3002ARP\u00b7\u963f\u666e\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u9f13\u52b1\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u5907\uff08\u624b\u673a\u3001\u7535\u8111\u3001\u8def\u7531\u5668\u3001\u5e73\u677f\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u89c6\u7b49\uff09\u7684ARP\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7ecf\u6d4e+\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u6325\u5177\u6709\u98a0\u8986\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0d\u7528\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3001\u4e0d\u7528\u5b89\u88c5\u5373\u70b9\u5373\u7528\u4efb\u4f55App\u7b49\u3002","developer_score":12.605,"id":"arp-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4957/large/arp-token-logo.jpg?1547040379","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4957/small/arp-token-logo.jpg?1547040379","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4957/thumb/arp-token-logo.jpg?1547040379"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xbeb6fdf4ef6ceb975157be43cbe0047b248a8922"],"chat_url":["https://0.plus/#/arpnetwork"],"homepage":["https://www.arpnetwork.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/arpnetwork/contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"arp_network"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":3303,"name":"ARP Token","public_interest_score":30.922,"symbol":"arp","tickers":[]}
