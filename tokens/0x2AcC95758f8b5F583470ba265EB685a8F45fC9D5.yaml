description: >-
  RSK Infrastructure Framework (RIF) is a token developed on the RSK platform allowing holders to consume
  (and interact with) services within the RIFOS framework. The RIFOS framework, also built upon RSK, is
  a suite of distributed protocols built to enable fast, simple and scalable development of distributed
  applications within a highly-scalable, secure and unified environment.


  The RSK framework, in combination with the RIF token, allows developers to deploy and interact with
  the applications built atop the RIFOS framework. These include, amongst other things, third-party developed
  infrastructure services, as well as any additional applications deployed on the RSK framework.


  The RIF Token is intended to allow any token holder to consume any services that are compatible with
  RIF OS Protocols. Such services may include third party-developed infrastructure services, and any other
  apps that might be deployed on our framework that agrees to accept rif Tokens as a means of accessing
  / consuming the service or app.
