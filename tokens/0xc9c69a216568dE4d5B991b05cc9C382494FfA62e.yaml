  OKAYAMA provides services and resources in exchange for YAMA token-an utility token that works on a
  DPoS algorithm. Each domain will connect to other domains based on contracts that provide the available
  services. A business gets its own network identity through which it can share and access data with others.
  Through a domain, users can operate on different governance models and create policies for their data.
  We provide provides support for large transactions, allowing building business services to become significantly
  less difficult with a system that reduces the resources required to develop and deploy the storage and
  processing of offchain documents.
