  The Embermine Project is an effort to provide Users a versatile operating system for their endeavors.
  Within the Embermine community are Entities which connect to each other. While we may provide a variety
  of use cases up front, we encourage the entrepreneurial spirit to experiment. Not only do we want our
  Users to experiment with the tools available, we also encourage third party developers to create apps
  and plugins which integrate within Embermine, thereby enhancing the experience.
