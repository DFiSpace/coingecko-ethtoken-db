  Odyssey is primarily a decentralized sharing economy and peer-to-peer ecosystem, aiming to compete with
  and replace the likes of Airbnb and Uber. Odyssey dreams big - aiming to completely replace the concept
  of private ownership with an economy in which everything is shared and little is owned. It’s a long
  way from its goals, of course, but making peer-to-peer sharing more efficient with smart contracts is
  certainly a step in the right direction.


  The Odyssey website lists 9 advisors, with its primary two being Yi Shi, the CEO of Shanghai’s Avazu
  Holding, a leading global advertising platform, and Justin Sun, the backbone of the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron">TRON</a>
  cryptocurrency. The advisory team also includes Goh Jian Kai, founder and CEO of Southeast Asia’s cross-border
  payment solution system RateX.


  Odyssey has lofty goals, aiming to create a world where sharing is the norm and ownership or sharing
  monopoly doesn’t come in the way of people’s lives. A decentralized sharing platform where all service
  providers and customers are connected definitely sounds attractive. It’s a new currency, so it needs
  development to reach its goals. Of course, the fact that buying a large number of OCN tokens will not
  put a major dent in your pocket is a definite point in its favour.
