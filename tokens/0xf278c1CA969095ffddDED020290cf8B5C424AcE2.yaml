description: >-
  As an architecture combining block chain and internet of things (IoT), Ruff Chain includes a public
  chain for development as well as a distributed operating system. It extends the point-to-point network
  and consensus mechanism from the virtual to real world, and promotes the motion of atomic flow by information
  flow. RUFF Tokens, validated by virtual currency contracts, are placed in the Ruff Chain; they are the
  standards for incentivizing, consuming, and trading in the Ruff Chain community.
