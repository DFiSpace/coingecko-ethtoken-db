  Superedge focus on the research of distributed cloud computing.


  ECT(Edge Compute Token)is the low cost of computing cloud edge computing resources.


  It is also a necessary condition for running the node.


  Superedge allows open versions of such services to be created on its public chain, and then incorporated
  by private networks in the form of building blocks. Token holders ensure governance and allow developers
  to customize it to meet their own needs.
