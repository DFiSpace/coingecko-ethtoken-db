  A high-throughput, DAG-based protocol capable of powering any application.


  Wavelet | Wasm smart contracts powered by a high-speed ledger. We utilise our unique Wavelet probabilistic
  DAG-protocol mechanism to facilitate over 31k+ transactions per second and 0-4 second time to finality.


  What is Wavelet?

  Wavelet is Perlinâ€™s directed acyclic graph (DAG) based protocol.


  It is a base-layer ledger which means anyone can build any type of application. It is designed to be
  the fastest, most secure, and most scalable distributed ledger solution in existence today. Wavelet
  is underpinned by a new and leaderless proof-of-stake consensus model (LPOS).


  One of our first use cases for Wavelet is international trade and commerce. Wavelet is well suited for
  increasing efficiency and transparency for complex processes (that have many inputs and output) such
  as supply chains and international commerce.


  While our first commercial focus is bringing Wavelet to the international trade and commerce arena,
  it is a very flexible protocol and can facilitate a myriad of use cases. Building on Wavelet is designed
  to be super easy, and we encourage experimentation. If we identify promising real-world applications
  built on Wavelet, the Perlin team will provide grants and support to facilitate commercial success.
