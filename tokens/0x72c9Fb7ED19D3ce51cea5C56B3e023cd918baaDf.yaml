  The Agrolot Project is a decentralized B2B platform for international trade if agricultural crops and
  food products. It is currently running a crowdfunding campaign built on Blockchain technology featuring
  Smart Contracts. The innovation of this projects includes:


  1. A simple conclusion of transactions by the use of smart-contracts and an ultimate execution;

  2. Efficient and economic benefits to all trading participants within the trading transactions;

  3. Secured and transparent transactions on the basis of blockchain and all its members.


  The making this project was as a result of our experience in the market of international trade in products
  of agriculture and food stuffs. We have made all our businesses processes rational such as finance,
  logistics, storage, insurance. After testing all similar platforms, we have concluded that the majority
  of them offer services of the local nature and are not meant for real trading and getting real results,
  instead they are only informative. We give a critical solution in the global trade. It will allow both
  small and medium sized manufactures and buyers to reach mutually beneficial deals from all over the
  world. In addition to that we guarantee payment security by the use of smart contracts; delivering all
  goods to their destinations safely
