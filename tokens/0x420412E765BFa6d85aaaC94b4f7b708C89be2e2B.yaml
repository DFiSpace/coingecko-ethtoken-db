description: >-
  BRZ is the first stable coin backed by Brazilian Reais (BRL). It'll allow Brazilian residents to directly
  ramp up in international exchanges and actively trade the Brazilian currency against pairs of different
  classes, including Bitcoin, other stable coins, utility and security tokens. It will be a powerful tool
  that will allow Brazilians to move and hedge Brazilians reais internationally. BRZ is always fully backed
  and holders can either purchase it for 1BRL or redeem it with a discount of 1% in Brazil.
