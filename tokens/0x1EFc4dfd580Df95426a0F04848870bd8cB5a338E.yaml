  ACADEMY IS ISSUING AN ACADEMY TOKEN (ACAD) ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN

  ACAD will be a means of paying for immersive training programs, educational offerings, and to access
  online content.


  Corporations looking for highly trained developers can use their tokens to bid for Academy-accredited
  graduates through the HR Advisory.


  ACAD is poised to underpin the economic ecosystem of blockchain education by addressing the looming
  developer shortfall which could throw future blockchain innovations and initiatives into crisis.
