  Juriseum is a platform for rethinking the way we interact with legal documents & data.


  While existing systems for legal documents are inefficient, not transparent, and are not secure, our
  team is building a secure, useful, & easy-to-use platform based on blockchain technology. It will include
  an immutable and transparent ledger for legal records & documents, and even a digital arbitration system.


  At the end, Our aim is to integrate records and data between involved parties into a unified blockchain
  ecosystem, which will make existing legal systems truly efficient, transparent, and reliable.
