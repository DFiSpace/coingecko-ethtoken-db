  TenX is a payment platform that facilitates digital and physical modes of transaction for cryptocurrencies
  to any merchant, even if they donâ€™t accept cryptocurrencies. Physical and digital modes of course, include
  bank accounts, wallets, debit cards, cash and much more. The primary agenda of the company is to make
  it easier and faster to use cryptocurrency and accelerate adoption for the industry. The TenX blockchain
  supports the PAY token, which is the fuel that runs the network and is the cryptocurrency using which
  transactions on the network are made.


  TenX came into existence in 2011 and was created by Toby Hoenisch. While at the university, he took
  a keen interest in cryptography though he believed that there was no success for cryptocurrencies.In
  2012, Toby started trading Bitcoin when he got to know a member of bitcoin-community who was not able
  to open an account in bank and used TenX crypto currency instead. Toby Hoenisch and Michael Sperk started
  a one-bit start up in 2015 and introduced us to a debit card, through which payments with bitcoin could
  be done.


  Cryptocurrency adoption is a longstanding problem - with most cryptocurrencies remaining relegated to
  the realms of hype and not seeing real-world usage, not as much as the enthusiasts would like, at least.
  This is an important problem being solved by the TenX coin, which seeks to make it easy for the end
  user to use cryptocurrencies by removing the hurdles associated with keeping different wallets and using
  them separately. As with all other investments, it is wise to do your own research, but seeing that
  TenX seems to be solving unique problems, it may certainly be worth a look.
