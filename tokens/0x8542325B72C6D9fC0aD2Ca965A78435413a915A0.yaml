  Oyster Unlocks the Dormant Revenue Potential of Millions of Websites. PRL is the economic bridge between
  content publishers, content consumers, storage providers, and storage consumers. Oyster is a revolutionary
  protocol that resets the assumptions of the current internet paradigm and addresses the aforementioned
  issues with a new comprehensive platform. Oysterâ€™s primary operation is based off of the storage, retention,
  and retrieval of static data. The PRL token enables such data storage and is the first asset to be pegged
  to a known market value without a reserve or a centralized guarantor. Additionally, the operation of
  the core Oyster network inadvertently creates a latency-optimized meshnet of nodes, which becomes the
  perfect environment for fostering decentralized communications.
