  Butterfly (abbreviated as BK), also called butterfly coin in Chinese, is a new generation of investment
  currency based on block chain technology, designed jointly by 17 famous economists from Singapore, the
  United States, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan and the United Kingdom. BK uses complex economic models
  to design and anchor the diversification of digital assets to realize the magnification of investment
  value.

  BK anchors more than 100 mainstream digital assets (including, but not limited to, BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,EOS,
  LTC, XMR, DOGE, IOTA, DASH, NEO, etc.) at a fixed exchange rate. Users can convert BK currency into
  mainstream digital assets through bk.run anchor currency exchange transaction matching engine.

  Today, with the development of digital currency, technology is being updated constantly and investors'needs
  are constantly changing. From decentralized BTC to stable USDT, we can see investors'expectations and
  aspirations for the development of digital currency. The emergence of BK as investment currency will
  conform to market trends and respond to investors' deepest inner needs.
