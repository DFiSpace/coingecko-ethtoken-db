The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we\u2019re just going to focus on their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about future events.\n\nUsers in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia is Gnosis\u2019s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product, so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a beta version in December 2017 but haven\u2019t announced a date for the main net release. The Management Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis\u2019s prediction markets. It\u2019s here that you check your balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.\n\nGnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren\u2019t minting any additional ones. These are the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL usage over the previous 3 months.\n\nThe Gnosis team is led by Martin K\u00f6ppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO). K\u00f6ppelmann and George began working on the platform in January 2015 as one of the first ConsenSys partners. By August of that same year, they launched the alpha product as the first major dapp on Ethereum. In April 2017, the project held somewhat of a controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/gnosis\">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>. Using a dutch auction style of raising funds, the team hit their $12.5 million hard cap in ten minutes while retaining 95% of the tokens. Amidst backlash, the team locked the tokens in a vault and have promised not to dump them on the market. They\u2019ll give at least a three-month warning before selling any of the tokens. The team includes quite a list of reputable advisors including Joseph Lubin (Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder and chief scientist).","id":"gnosis","links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1529098,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96","https://etherscan.io/token/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96"],"facebook_username":"Gnosis.pm","homepage":["https://gnosis.pm/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis.js"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/gnosisPM","twitter_screen_name":"gnosisPM"},"name":"Gnosis","symbol":"gno","tickers":[{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"abcc","name":"ABCC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"airswap","name":"AirSwap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"blockonix","name":"Blockonix"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"coin_exchange","name":"Coinexchange"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"credoex","name":"CredoEx"},"target":"CREDO"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"CRD"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"cryptaldash","name":"CryptalDash"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"ethfinex","name":"Ethfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"EUR"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gobaba","name":"Gobaba"},"target":"TRY"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"gopax","name":"GoPax"},"target":"KRW"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"joyso","name":"Joyso"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"LA"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"65998168-6996-4EF1-88AD-246591316C7D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"65998168-6996-4EF1-88AD-246591316C7D","market":{"identifier":"lykke","name":"Lykke"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"orderbook","name":"Orderbook.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"poloniex","name":"Poloniex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"poloniex","name":"Poloniex"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"DAI"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"radar_relay","name":"Radar Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"tokenjar","name":"TokenJar"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"GNO","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]}
