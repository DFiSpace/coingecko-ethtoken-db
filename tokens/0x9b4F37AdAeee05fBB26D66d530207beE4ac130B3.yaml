  With TrustedCars Flex you can choose any vehicle you want from the available inventory of participating
  car dealers within the TrustedCars Flex network, digitally sign for it in the app and you are ready
  to go. Drive the vehicle you like as long as you want and return it or swap for another vehicle anytime.


  With our unique combination of technology expertise and deep industry relationships we have designed
  a solution that offers consumers an affordable, all-inclusive and commitment-free way to own a vehicle
  without ownership responsibilities. In parallel we offer dealerships an additional source of income
  and access to a new generation of consumers.
