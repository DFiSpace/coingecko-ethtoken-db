  Starbull Travel is a decentralized travel service system based on blockchain technology. It builds a
  transparent, trustworthy, low-cost, decentralized future travel ecosystem by linking global travel service
  providers (enterprises and individuals) with consumers.

  The front-end application of the Starsbull Travel Share will cover the WAP,WEB, and APP terminals, and
  at the same time, a series of smart contracts will complete the internal information exchange and instruction
  execution. At the back end, it will combine the characteristics of the bottom-level service public and
  private chains and the characteristics of the tourism eco-industry. It covers different scenarios such
  as consumption, finance, content, and social networking, and corresponds to different technical frameworks
  to achieve a complex tourism blockchain ecosystem.
