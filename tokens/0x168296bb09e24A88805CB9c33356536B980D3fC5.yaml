  RChain is a fundamentally new blockchain platform rooted in a formal model of concurrent and decentralized
  computation. The RChain Cooperative is leveraging that model through correct-by-construction software
  development to produce a concurrent, compositional, and massively scalable blockchain. he industry has
  spoken, the blockchain platforms of today, and as they are currently built, are not fit for scale or
  speed, they continue to lack security and they are not designed for the masses in the developer community.
  We have all heard of the problems within the ever expanding blockchain space. The fact that scalability
  isn’t just the giant elephant in the room, it’s that elephant that hastaken over the room. They are
  slow. Security – one needs to look no further than the recent events of not just (Initial Coin Offerings)
  ICO’s being hacked but exchanges, wallets and entire systems as well. The blockchain space is not for
  everyone - there a limited few developers in the world today that can build upon any of the existing
  blockchains.


  Greg is the founder and visionary behind RChain, with a tremendous passion for mathematics and over
  30 years of high level experience driving innovative technology projects. Greg is the Co-founder, President
  and Member of the Board of Directors of The RChain Cooperative. Previously he was the Principal Architect
  of Microsoft's BizTalk Process Orchestration, Principal Architect of Microsoft's Highwire offering as
  well as Principal Architect of ATM Network management solution for ATT/NCR and Co- designer and developer
  of MCC's Rosette/ESS technology. No discussion about Greg would be complete without mentioning his unwavering
  passion/devotion (understatement) to the environment. he Co-op is the organization that develops the
  open-source RChain platform software. It’s an open and community-driven initiative with multiple communication
  channels through which all are welcome to participate. The Co-op is dependent on participation from
  its members. This will be crucial for governance, innovation and adoption.


  Rhain has cooperatively <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/rchain">sold $15 million</a> worth
  of RHOC (valued at $0.20 each at the time) during its sale. The current iteration of RChain RHOC is
  an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Once the RChain mainnet launches (tentatively scheduled
  for the end of 2018), RHOC tokens will convert to REV tokens at a 1:1 ratio. The tokens are used to
  compensate node operators for computing and storing system contracts, along with bandwidth resources.
  They’re also a staking currency used for consensus and validator bonding.
