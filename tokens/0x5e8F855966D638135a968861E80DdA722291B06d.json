Coinvest empowers anyone to virtually invest in individual or a curated index of cryptonized assets through one coin. Coinvest is creating a future where users have one platform, one wallet, and one token (COIN), that enables anyone to create a digital investment portfolio to invest in multiple cryptocurrencies. Thereby reducing the cost, risk, and complexity associated with investing in cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges or investment funds. Centralized third parties that are often needed in traditional investment use cases are replaced with smart contracts that act as autonomous agents and programmatically compensate all users, investors, and owners within the entire Coinvest ecosystem","developer_score":34.239,"id":"coinvest","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2394/large/coinvest.png?1547036572","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2394/small/coinvest.png?1547036572","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2394/thumb/coinvest.png?1547036572"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2381017,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x5e8f855966d638135a968861e80dda722291b06d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x5e8f855966d638135a968861e80dda722291b06d"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/ZAyB8VV"],"facebook_username":"CoinvestHQ","homepage":["https://coinve.st/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/CoinvestHQ/COIN"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Coinvest","telegram_channel_identifier":"CoinvestHQ","twitter_screen_name":"CoinvestHQ"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":1988,"name":"Coinvest","public_interest_score":29.361,"symbol":"coin","tickers":[]}
