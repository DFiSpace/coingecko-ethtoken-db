description: >-
  Logistics is defined as “the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities,
  or supplies”. Blockchain technology provides a perfect solution for coordinating complex operations
  amongst numerous constituents.


  Serve’s mission is to provide an intuitive, transparent, decentralized, and open-source platform to
  increase efficiency and reduce costs for all parties in an open-source global economy. The effect of
  this revolutionary platform will be to create new global, e-commerce and logistics solutions by obviating
  the significant problems caused by having too many hands, too many platforms, and too little transparency.
  We believe that the Serve platform can empower Users (i.e., patrons).
