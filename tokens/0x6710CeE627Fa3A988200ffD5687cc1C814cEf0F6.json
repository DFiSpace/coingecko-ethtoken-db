The platform allows to invest in our projects in a simple and secure way. We provide investors with an opportunity to invest their assets in real property sector, through our projects by using the Fortem Capital token. We have many years\u2019 experience and so far we have carried out the projects of a total value exceeding 40 million USD.\n\nIEO offered by Fortem Capital is based on tangible assets. The purpose of our own IEO is to raise funds for our platform Fortem Capital and the development of selected projects. An investor will be able to enter into a trust agreement thus taking on a desired percentage of shares of a property to be further resold. The investor will know from the start the projected return on their investment.\n\nThe process from the acquisition a property through its renovation and culminating in its further reselling is overseen by Fortem Capital in full. When a property is sold, the investor receives their share in cryptocurrency and their return depends on the final property selling price. That price should not be lower than the projected total return.\n\nAs part of the first stage of the IEO, Fortem Capital selected a number of real estate projects. Their aggregate worth (including the cost of construction/renovation but excluding investor and company fees) stands at $35 million.\n\nIEO Fortem Capital will be on the Coinsbit.io.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"fortem-capital","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8768/large/64d4csh4_400x400.png?1574683685","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8768/small/64d4csh4_400x400.png?1574683685","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8768/thumb/64d4csh4_400x400.png?1574683685"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@CapitalFortem"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5153196,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x6710cee627fa3a988200ffd5687cc1c814cef0f6"],"chat_url":["https://www.linkedin.com/company/fortem-capital-s-a/"],"facebook_username":"Fortemcapitalsa","homepage":["https://fortemcoin.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/FortemCapitalOU/token"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"fortemcapital","twitter_screen_name":"CapitalFortem"},"liquidity_score":15.661,"market_cap_rank":4511,"name":"Fortem Capital","public_interest_score":24.311,"symbol":"fcq","tickers":[{"base":"FCQ","market":{"identifier":"coinsbit","name":"Coinsbit"},"target":"USD"}]}
