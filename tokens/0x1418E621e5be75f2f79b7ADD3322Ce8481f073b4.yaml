  The Data market is estimated at over 3 Trillion Dollars. Without even knowing it, humans have become
  instruments of data collection through their actions, movements and behaviors, creating value for others.


  Dataeum aims to disrupt the existing paradigm, by creating the first blockchain-based platform which
  uses crowdsourcing to enable the collection of 100% of all global physical data (such as stores, gas
  stations, traffic signs, etc) anywhere in the world, with 100% accuracy.


  It does this through a mobile app and by using a distributed workforce of “collectors” who are incentivised
  in XDT tokens.


  The solution’s efficiency has already been proven during three collection campaigns completed in Paris,
  Barcelona and London.


  Dataeum will become the most used data blockchain in the real world thanks to its community that will
  collect millions of physical data around the globe.
