From being totally paper based, it is now very much a digital market. In spite of the efficiency brought by digital coupons, the underlying payment processes remain overly complex with middlemen adding unnecessary costs. While the digital coupons can bring a fresh user experience and widen consumer reach, billions of consumers are still confined to a passive role as in a B2C market. Mezzofy (Hong Kong) Limited (\u201cMezzofy\u201d) has become one of the market leaders in Hong Kong and Asia and the Mezzofy Group now wishes to take a leadership role in delivering the efficiencies that blockchain unlocks, combining innovation in point of sale technology, coupon authentication techniques, the near ubiquitous use of social media and last, but by no means least, a considerably more fluid payments and settlements system. In so doing, it has the full support of a long list of high profile international brands.\n\nTo execute these changes, the Mezzofy Group is now embarking on a Token Generation Event (TGE), seeking to raise US$24 million. It is well positioned to deliver on these innovations. It has already issued more than 200,000,000 coupons and numbers such well-known brand names as Maxims Group, Starbucks and the Hong Kong Airport Authority among its existing client base. It plans to use the funds to significantly enhance the user experience in the B2C coupon market and to extend it into the still dormant B2B and C2C spheres.","id":"coupon-chain-token","links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@couponchain"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":4989769,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xfc4b9e2d71a7795102Eb0C0e8b5DA992946a62De"],"facebook_username":"CouponChain","homepage":["https://www.coupon-chain.org"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/mezzofy/coupon-chain-ico"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"couponchaintoken","twitter_screen_name":"Coupon_chain"},"name":"Coupon Chain Token","symbol":"cct","tickers":[]}
