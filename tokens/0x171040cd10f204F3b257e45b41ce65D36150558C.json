Approximately 0.5% of tokens are sent to a burn address with each token transfer.\n\nThe BOMB token experiment on the Ethereum chain has gained considerable interest due to the mechanism of deflation by transactional coin burn with each transfer. Clones and clone variants have rapidly appeared; usually modified in terms of the decimal value and the burn rate. Suprisingly, until the launch of eBOMB, no variant of the smart contract has been deployed to Ethereum Classic.\n\neBOMB embraces the immutable nature of Ethereum Classic and the continued commitment to Proof of Work (POW) as the original and most powerful mechanism for preserving the integrity of a blockchain ledger.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"ebomb","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9020/large/ebomb.png?1565758215","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9020/small/ebomb.png?1565758215","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9020/thumb/ebomb.png?1565758215"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/tokens/0x171040cd10f204f3b257e45b41ce65d36150558c/token_transfers"],"homepage":["http://ebomb.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/eBOMB-POW/eBOMB"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"eBOMB_POW","twitter_screen_name":"eBOMB_POW"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":6054,"name":"EBOMB","public_interest_score":23.977,"symbol":"pow","tickers":[{"base":"POW","market":{"identifier":"saturn_network","name":"Saturn Network"},"target":"ETC"}]}
