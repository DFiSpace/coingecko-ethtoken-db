description: >-
  We are going to turn the tables. Instead of raising money through speculation and hype, we are going
  to build a community that proves the power of a cryptocurrency through hard work and dedication. A currency
  that rebels from the trend of making fast cash with an ICO and focuses on sustained and meaningful usability
  â€“ built by a community that cares. With a strong community, Rebellious will show actions are what count,
  and become the product cryptocurrencies are made out to be.
